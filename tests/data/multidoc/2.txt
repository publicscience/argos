There are a few broad trends in the U.S. economy getting lots of attention lately. The job market appears to be increasingly polarized, with high-paid and low-paid occupations growing quickly, while middle-class jobs are disappearing. And on top of that, median wages have stagnated over the past decade.

That's one way to see the labor market getting increasingly polarized over the past decade, as industries with low average pay grow significantly and mid-range industries wither â€” mainly driven by the steep decline in U.S. manufacturing.
We can also focus specifically on the recession and its aftermath. Mark Thoma points to research from Joshua Lerner of the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis, looking at specific occupations rather than broad industries. 

Over at the Economic Policy Institute, however, Josh Bivens argues that this sort of tech-driven polarization isn't enough to explain stagnant median wages over the past decade. "We would argue," he writes, "that institutional factors like the eroding value of the minimum wage as a labor standard and eroding protections for willing workers that want to form a union are more important drivers of inequality and disappointing middle-class living standards over the past generation."
