Dr. King was assassinated by a gunman in 1968. On Friday the official Twitter account of the Marine Corps Special Operations Command posted a picture and message that appeared to make light of the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at the start of the long holiday weekend to commemorate his birth. The Tweet contained a picture of a gunman taking aim through what appeared to be an open window and a message that read, \u201cDon\u2019t be a lone shooter MLK weekend! Make sure you\u2019ve got security \u2014 stay safe!\u201d The civil rights leader was assassinated by a gunman on April 4, 1968, as he stood on a balcony at the Lorraine Hotel in Memphis, Tenn. James Earl Ray confessed to the murder in March 1969 and spent the rest of his life in prison. The Tweet was posted to Twitter at 10:52 a.m. Friday and subsequently deleted from the MARSOC official account, @MARSOCofficial, which is linked to the recruitment page of the Marine Corps website.

The protesters' drive to force Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra from office and eliminate the influence of her brother, billionaire former leader Thaksin Shinawatra, has been marked by a series of escalating protests, each more ambitious than the last. Monday's rally was touted as a bid to shut down Bangkok for a week or more and reboot Thailand's democracy, this time without the powerful Shinawatra clan in command. Tens of thousands of people blocked intersections around the inner core of the capital in their latest effort to press Ms. Yingluck to resign, placing further strain on the outlook for Southeast Asia's second-largest economy. But with Ms. Yingluck claiming widespread support elsewhere in Thailand and planning new elections Feb. 2, protest leaders already are selecting higher-profile targets to attempt to force her out, including the headquarters of the Stock Exchange of Thailand. Perched in a bunker built from rubber tires and fortified with sharpened bamboo stakes near the government's main headquarters, Nitithorn Lamlua on Monday laid out some of the options the protesters could take if Ms. Yingluck refuses to quit. While much of Thailand's attention is focused on Suthep Thaugsuban, the backroom-operator former deputy premier who reinvented himself as a rabble-rousing figure at the head of the protest movement, it is Mr. Nitithorn who determines much of the group's strategy. And when he does act, it's usually to ratchet up the conflict a notch or two higher. Members of Mr. Nitithorn's faction, composed of trade unionists and militant student groups, last month broke into the army's headquarters in Bangkok, urging the military to not use arms against demonstrators. Mr. Nitithorn also led another rally at the U.S. Embassy warning America not to interfere in Thailand's affairs after its ambassador supported holding elections. On Dec. 26, Mr. Nitithorn's supporters led the blockade of election registration centers in Bangkok, triggering a fracas that left a policeman and a protester dead. \"We have to escalate things from time to time,\" said Mr. Nitithorn, 49 years old, rubbing the back of his shaved head. \"If Ms. Yingluck doesn't resign by Jan. 15, we have to look at what more we can do.\" And that, he said, could mean besieging the stock exchange, which rival pro-Shinawatra protesters tried to burn down in 2010. Other protest leaders suggested shutting down air traffic control systems at the city's airports. Stock Exchange of Thailand President Charamporn Jotikasthira told reporters that the exchange has several backup systems to enable it to continue trading. The benchmark SET Index, meanwhile, rose more than 2% to close at 1,283.56. The protesters' willingness to ramp up their campaign to overthrow the government, however, underscores the depth of feeling on both sides of the political divide in Thailand, an important U.S. ally in the region. Eight people have been killed in clashes between demonstrators and police or rival pro-government factions since the protests began last November. Drive-by shootings near protest camps are becoming a near-nightly occurrence. Ms. Yingluck has said new elections scheduled in three weeks are the best way to avoid a worsening spiral of violence and denies protesters' claims that she's acting as a puppet for her brother, Mr. Thaksin, who was overthrown in a military coup in 2006. Strong support for her government's populist subsidies and infrastructure programs in the vote-rich north and northeast of Thailand indicate that she is likely to win the ballot, if it goes ahead. Protest leaders argue that Ms. Yingluck's spending plans, like those pursued by Mr. Thaksin before the army removed him, are a form of bribery and are weakening Thailand's economy. They want to stop the election and install an unelected council to remold Thailand's political systems. \"We need to be patient. But if we gather in a nonviolent manner, people will come out again and again,\" Mr. Nitithorn said. Speaking to huge crowds later, Mr. Suthep said they would continue for \"as long as it takes.\" Indeed, despite Monday's protests, which police estimated at 75,000 people-strong, the conflict appears set to drag on, with the country's army saying it is unwilling to take sides and remove Ms. Yingluck like it removed Mr. Thaksin. Some analysts suggest this is a reason for optimism. Thailand's stability could improve if it somehow finds a way through the current mayhem without its army intervening as it has often done before. That's something that's becoming increasingly important as the stabilizing influence of Thailand's ailing, 86-year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej begins to wane. \"If this conflict can be resolved peacefully, no matter how long it takes, then that could be a breakthrough,\" says historian Thanet Apornsuwan.

Nancy Pelosi, surrounded by male members of Congress (Reuters)Women make up less than 20 percent of Congress. Out of 100 senators, 20 are female; out of 435 representatives, there are 78 women. According to the World Economic Forum, that puts the United States at 60th in the world for political equality between the sexes, right behind countries like Sri Lanka, Serbia, and Senegal. A series from The Atlantic and The Shriver Report Read More At The Atlantic's Shriver Report summit on women and poverty on Wednesday, former House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi offered her thoughts on why this gap persists. \u201cIf you reduce the role of money in politics and increase the level of civility in debate, more women will run for office,\u201d she said. To Pelosi, this isn't a question of ability; women are quite capable of raising the money they need to run for office, she said. This is a cultural question: Expensive campaigns create a political environment that alienates women with families or other job prospects. \"Look, I\u2019ve had $100 million spent mischaracterizing who I am,\" she said. \u201cWomen see that and they say, 'I could never take that. I would never subject my family to any mischaracterizations about me.'\" Because of this, women who are leaders in other fields shy away from diving into the all-out battle of running for office. A young woman who might be considering it says, well, I could do this, this, or this, or I could have somebody spend millions of dollars mischaracterizing who I am so my children come home crying from school because someone told them about their mother who they saw on TV. We say to women, we want you to go raise 12 million dollars, and by the way, subject yourself to 10 million dollars in negative publicity, and by the way, if you\u2019re forceful in your presentation, you\u2019re striding too strong. Although reforming campaign finance rules might create more equal access to dirty campaigning tools, it seems unlikely that character assassinations would subside significantly. Pelosi does have a worthwhile point about culture, though: The circus of politics might be more alienating to women than to men, especially women with families. That this observation rings true says just as much about gender politics as it does about legislative politics: If campaigning is so harmful to families, men should be just as reluctant to get involved.

This is a cultural question: \u00a0Expensive campaigns create a political environment that alienates women with families or other job prospects.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>\"Look, I\u2019ve had $100 million spent mischaracterizing who I am,\" she said. \u201cWomen see that and they say, 'I could never take that. I would never subject my family to any mischaracterizations about me.'\"</p>\n\n<p>Because of this, women who are leaders in other fields shy away from diving into the all-out battle of running for office.</p>\n\n<blockquote>A young woman who might be considering it says, well, I could do this, this, or this, or I could have somebody spend millions of dollars mischaracterizing who I am so my children come home crying from school because someone told them about their mother who they saw on TV.\n<p>We say to women, we want you to go raise 12 million dollars, and by the way, subject yourself to 10 million dollars in negative publicity, and by the way, if you\u2019re forceful in your presentation, you\u2019re striding too strong.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Although reforming campaign finance rules might create more equal access to dirty campaigning tools, it seems unlikely that character assassinations would subside significantly. Pelosi does have a worthwhile point about culture, though: The circus of politics might be more alienating to women than to men, especially women with families. That this observation rings true says just as much about gender politics as it does about legislative politics: If campaigning is so harmful to families, men should be just as reluctant to get involved.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>For another interesting note on the gender gap in politics, see\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/01/battle-of-the-sexes-mens-political-giving-dwarfs-womens/283075/\"><em>The Atlantic</em>'s David Graham</a> on why women spend significantly less money on political donations than men.\u00a0</p>\n        \n            </div>\n\n</div></body></html>"}, {"source": "http://www.economist.com/rss/international_rss.xml", "text": "WHEN Mark Morris, a Zurich-based tax consultant with a conscience, requested a meeting with the European Commission to explain the many devious ways in which tax evaders were using shell companies and other vehicles, a bored official offered him 20 minutes. \u201cOnce I started describing all the loopholes,\u201d Mr Morris recalls, \u201chis eyes lit up.

John Christensen of the Tax Justice Network, a pressure group, terms them \u201cone of the biggest nuts yet to be cracked.\u201d A trust typically involves three main parties: a settlor (who donates the assets), a trustee (who manages the arrangement) and beneficiaries (who are to receive the funds in future). Confusingly, ownership is split: the trustee is the legal owner, while the beneficiaries or the settlor, or both, can at different times exercise beneficial ownership or control who gets the money. A common-law concept, the trust plays a big role in Britain\u2019s offshore satellites, especially Jersey, a small island with 4,500 trust professionals. In continental Europe and jurisdictions such as Panama, foundations and anstalts serve a similar purpose. These arrangements can be wholly legitimate: ring-fencing a company\u2019s pension assets in the event of a takeover, for example. For minimising tax, corporate structures are generally more useful. Moreover, notes George Hodgson of the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners: \u201cTrustees must know the full details of the beneficial owners and typically must pass that information on to competent authorities when requested.\u201d It is in trustees\u2019 interest to ensure tax is paid, he adds, because they are personally liable if it isn\u2019t.

A report in 2011 by the Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative, a joint UN/World Bank project, noted that trusts crop up less commonly than shell companies in corruption investigations. But it suggested that their misuse might be underreported, because trusts often baffle investigators, who instead focus on other targets. So-called discretionary trusts are particularly open to abuse. Their assets sit in a kind of ownerless limbo: given away, legally speaking, but without a recipient, so long as the beneficiaries are not defined. (They may even be children or grandchildren as yet unborn.)

Such trusts are an \u201cimportant and tricky\u201d issue for tax authorities, says Konstantin Lozev, a European Commission official. Lucky orphans, happy benefactors The \u201cvast majority\u201d of trusts in Jersey are discretionary, says Alan Binnington, president of the island\u2019s trust-companies association. New types of ownerless structure are being created all the time. A bill awaiting parliamentary approval in Luxembourg, for example, would create Fondations Patrimoniales (private foundations). KPMG, an accountancy firm, describes this to clients as a shareholder-less \u201corphan entity\u201d with \u201cparticularly attractive\u201d tax advantages. The beneficiary can be another foundation or trust. These discretionary structures lead a charmed life. For example, they gained a surprising exemption from the bilateral deals between Switzerland and other European countries that were supposed to flush out undeclared money. Some countries have begun to take a harder line. France has changed its law to treat all potential trust beneficiaries as owners for tax purposes\u2014even if they never receive a penny. Under America\u2019s Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), which is to take effect next year, trusts will face many of the same Draconian reporting obligations as banks. The European Commission has proposed several amendments to its savings-tax directive, in a bid to close the loopholes that Mr Morris and others have identified. These could become part of the cross-border framework for exchange of tax information emerging under the aegis of the OECD, a rich-country think-tank. The new EU regime would reject the idea of ownerless assets, at least for trusts managed in the EU and dependent territories (which make up most such arrangements worldwide). In effect, until the beneficiary has received money, the original owner will be deemed to have retained them and be liable for tax. The trustee will be obliged to help enforce this. So far Luxembourg has been a sticking point. Its financial industry thrives on tax-friendliness and secrecy. It says it will sign up only when Switzerland, Monaco and other non-EU European states agree to exchange information automatically.

If it is approved, the Modern Language Association would be the fourth, and by far the largest, such group to endorse a measure critical of Israel in the past year.The travel resolution did not call for a boycott like the one announced last month by the American Studies Association, which has prompted a backlash, including statements from more than 100 university presidents criticizing boycotts as a threat to academic freedom.The group\u2019s delegate assembly also voted against considering a second resolution, introduced by its Radical Caucus, to condemn the \u201cattacks on the A.S.A.\u201d and defend the right of individual scholars and groups to \u201ctake positions in solidarity with the Palestinian struggle against racism.\u201dBut among partisans on both sides, the debate on the resolution was seen as an important skirmish in the larger battle over the international boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement, known as B.D.S.\u201cThe main goal of the process is raising awareness of egregious and decades-long complicity of Israeli institutions in the regime of occupation, colonialism and apartheid,\u201d Omar Barghouti, a Palestinian founder of B.D.S., said on Thursday after participating in a round-table discussion of academic boycotts.Before the group\u2019s four-day annual meeting began, the debate seemed to bring as much attention to the policies of the M.L.A., starting with the approval last spring of the round table on boycotts. Two pro-Israel groups, Hillel International and the Israel on Campus Coalition, issued a statement criticizing the group for accepting a lineup with only scholars who were broadly supportive of the B.D.S. movement. They also organized a counterpanel at a nearby hotel featuring prominent M.L.A. members who are opposed to boycotts.Some of them defended the group\u2019s right to approve such a gathering, saying that many scholarly panels are devoted to exploring one point of view. But at the panel, and in leaflets distributed during the meeting, they questioned the documentary evidence provided by supporters of the travel resolution, as well as its singular focus on Israel.\u201cI would strongly support a resolution looking into refusal of visas for all countries,\u201d Cary Nelson, a former president of the American Association of University Professors, said during the debate on Saturday. He added: \u201cThis is a biased resolution.\u201dFull passage is by no means assured. Some of the scholars chatting in the halls between panels on topics like \u201cMiddle English Keywords\u201d or \u201cAfrican American Voices From the Civil War\u201d said they were unconcerned about the measure, or even unaware of it.Others expressed dismay at what they saw as a conversation that slid too quickly on both sides from issues of academic freedom to partisan claims.\u201cIt arrived partisan, and it never had a chance to become nonpartisan,\u201d said Derrick Miller, an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina in Wilmington and a member of the delegate assembly. \u201cI hear echoes of cable news debates rather than something academic.\u201dDiscussion grew even more heated at the assembly. Mr. Nelson suggested that removing the word \u201carbitrary\u201d from the resolution\u2019s description of Israel\u2019s denials of entry had made the resolution meaningless, while supporters criticized a last-minute effort to introduce a substitute resolution applying to all governments as \u201cprocedural obstruction.\u201dAfter the vote, Mr. Nelson and other opponents predicted it would damage the association and its broader mission of promoting the beleaguered humanities. But Bruce Robbins, a professor at Columbia and one of the resolution\u2019s sponsors, defended the measure. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a dangerous politicization to defend the rights of academics,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we did.\u201d Correction: January 13, 2014 An earlier version of article misstated the name of one pro-Israel group that criticized the Modern Language Association resolution. It is the Israel on Campus Coalition, not the Israel Campus Coalition.

The protesters' drive to force Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra from office and eliminate the influence of her brother, billionaire former leader Thaksin Shinawatra, has been marked by a series of escalating protests, each more ambitious than the last. Monday's rally was touted as a bid to shut down Bangkok for a week or more and reboot Thailand's democracy, this time without the Shinawatra clan in command. Tens of thousands of people blocked intersections around the inner core of the capital in their latest effort to press Ms. Yingluck to resign, placing further strain on the outlook for Southeast Asia's second-largest economy. But with Ms. Yingluck claiming widespread support elsewhere in Thailand and planning new elections Feb. 2, protest leaders already are selecting higher-profile targets to attempt to force her out, including the headquarters of the Stock Exchange of Thailand. Perched in a bunker built from rubber tires and fortified with sharpened bamboo stakes near the government's main headquarters, Nitithorn Lamlua on Monday laid out some of the options the protesters could take if Ms. Yingluck refuses to quit. While much of Thailand's attention is focused on Suthep Thaugsuban, the backroom operatorformer deputy premier who reinvented himself as a rabble-rousing figure at the head of the protest movement, it is Mr. Nitithorn who determines much of the group's strategy. Members of Mr. Nitithorn's faction, composed of trade unionists and militant student groups, last month broke into the army's headquarters in Bangkok, urging the military not to use arms against demonstrators. Mr. Nitithorn also led another rally at the U.S. Embassy, warning America not to interfere in Thailand's affairs after its ambassador supported holding elections. On Dec. 26, Mr. Nitithorn's supporters led the blockade of election registration centers in Bangkok, triggering a fracas that left a policeman and a protester dead. \"We have to escalate things from time to time,\" said Mr. Nitithorn, 49 years old. \"If Ms. Yingluck doesn't resign by Jan. 15, we have to look at what more we can do.\" And that, he said, could mean besieging the stock exchange, which rival pro-Shinawatra protesters tried to burn down in 2010. Other protest leaders suggested shutting down air-traffic-control systems at the city's airports. Stock Exchange of Thailand President Charamporn Jotikasthira told reporters that the exchange has several backup systems to enable it to continue trading. The benchmark SET Index, meanwhile, rose more than 2% to close at 1283.56 as investors took heart that Monday's protests weren't violent. The protesters' willingness to ramp up their campaign to overthrow the government, however, underscores the depth of feeling on both sides of the political divide in Thailand, an important U.S. ally in the region. Eight people have been killed in clashes between demonstrators and police or rival pro-government factions since the protests began in November. Drive-by shootings near protest camps are becoming a near-nightly occurrence. Ms. Yingluck has said new elections scheduled in three weeks are the best way to avoid a worsening spiral of violence and denies protesters' claims that she is acting as a puppet for her brother, Mr. Thaksin, who was overthrown in a military coup in 2006. Strong support for her government's populist subsidies and infrastructure programs in the vote-rich north and northeast of Thailand indicate that she is likely to win the ballot, if it goes ahead. Protest leaders argue that Ms. Yingluck's spending plans, like those pursued by Mr. Thaksin before the army removed him, are a form of bribery and are weakening Thailand's economy. They want to stop the election and install an unelected council to remold Thailand's political systems. \"We need to be patient. But if we gather in a nonviolent manner, people will come out again and again,\" Mr. Nitithorn said. Speaking to huge crowds later, Mr. Suthep said they would continue for \"as long as it takes.\" Thailand's army has said it is unwilling remove Ms. Yingluck as it removed Mr. Thaksin. Some analysts suggest this is a reason for optimism. Thailand's stability could improve if it somehow finds a way through the current mayhem without its army intervening as it has often done before. That is something that is becoming increasingly important as the stabilizing influence of Thailand's ailing, 86-year-old King Bhumibol Adulyadej begins to wane. \"If this conflict can be resolved peacefully, no matter how long it takes, then that could be a breakthrough,\" says historian Thanet Apornsuwan.

And many of my fellow Americans, some of whom are here, feel that same sense of loss.I say to Prime Minister Sharon\u2019s beloved and devoted sons, Omri and Gilad, and the entire family, particularly the sons who spent so much time caring for their father in the last few years, it\u2019s a great honor you\u2019ve afforded me on behalf of my country to bring the sympathies of the President of the United States and the American people on this occasion.To you, to Prime Minister Netanyahu and the government of Israel, to President Peres, and to the grieving men and women of the nation of Israel, but most particularly to his beloved IDF, his fellow warriors, I fear an attempt to capture him and what he stood for is beyond my capabilities. I knew him for over 30 years. He was not only a powerful man, he was a powerfully built man. And as a young senator, when you first met him you could not help but understand, as they say in the military, this man had a command presence. He filled the room.The first time I was invited to his office, he said to me -- and I remember thinking, is he serious? -- he said, Senator, you are mostly welcome. I didn\u2019t know if it was a matter of something being lost in translation or whether he was pulling my leg, as we say in the States, until I spent a few moments with him and realized how incredible his hospitality was. But when the topic of Israel\u2019s security arose, which it always, always, always did in my many meetings over the years with him, you immediately understood how he acquired, as the speakers referenced, the nickname \u201cBulldozer.\u201d He was indomitable.Like all historic leaders, Prime Minister Sharon was a complex man about whom, as you\u2019ve already heard from his colleagues, who engendered strong opinions from everyone. But like all historic leaders, all real leaders, he had a North Star that guided him -- a North Star from which he never, in my observation, never deviated. His North Star was the survival of the State of Israel and the Jewish people, wherever they resided.In talking about his spiritual attachment to the land of Israel back in an interview in the late \u201890s, he said, and I quote, \u201cBefore and above all else, I am a Jew. My thinking is dominated by the Jews\u2019 future in 30 years, in 300 years, in a thousand years. That\u2019s what preoccupies and interests me first and foremost.\u201d And because he possessed such incredible physical courage -- and I would add political courage -- he never, never, never deviated from that preoccupation and interest, as he referred to it. It was his life\u2019s work that even someone on the shores hundreds of -- thousands of miles from here could see, could smell, could taste, could feel, and when you were in his presence there was never, never any doubt about it.The physical courage he had to lead men straight into enemy lines and deep behind them. I remember, as a young senator, that iconic picture of him with that bandage around his head, standing there after a decisive victory, which seemed to symbolize, as Bibi -- as the Prime Minister said, an Israel that had reclaimed its roots of standing up and fighting, needing no help, standing on its own. The political courage it took, whether you agreed with him or not, when he told 10,000 Israelis to leave their homes in Gaza in order, from his perspective, to strengthen Israel. I can\u2019t think of much more controversial; as a student of the Jewish state, I can\u2019t think of a much more difficult and controversial decision that\u2019s been made. But he believed it and he did it.The security of his people was always Arik\u2019s unwavering mission, an unbreakable commitment to the future of Jews, whether 30 years or 300 years from now. We have an expression in the States: never in doubt. Arik was never uncertain from my observation. I don\u2019t know him nearly as well as the Israeli people and his colleagues, but he seemed never in doubt. But there were times when he acted, and those actions earned him controversy and even condemnation. And in certain instances, American leaders -- American Presidents -- had profound differences with him, and they were never shy about stating them nor was he ever shy about stating his position. As I said, from my observation he was a complex man, but to understand him better I think it\u2019s important history will judge he also lived in complex times, in a very complex neighborhood.Since he passed away, in the days ahead, there will be much written about the Prime Minister. And it\u2019s right for the Israeli people to reflect on all aspects of his life -- the triumphs as well as the mistakes, taking full measure of the man, the arc of his life. For I would argue the arc of his life traced the journey of the State of Israel.And through it all, the United States whether we agreed or disagreed with a specific policy has been unflagging in its commitment to the State of Israel. We have never stepped away. We have never diminished our support. We have never failed to make Israel\u2019s case around the world. We have never failed to defend Israel\u2019s legitimacy.And no one in any corner of this world has any doubt about where America stands with regard to Israeli security, the independent State of Israel that is the ultimate refuge for Jews wherever they are in the world. And that will never change.As President Obama said when he was here in Jerusalem last year, and I quote, \u201cThose who adhere to the ideology of rejecting Israel\u2019s right to exist, they might as well reject the earth beneath them and the sky above because Israel is not going anywhere. So long as there is a United States of America, you are not alone.\u201dFor his part, Arik Sharon greatly valued that close friendship between the United States and Israel, and particularly during his years as prime minister, he worked hard to deepen our relationship.I find it fascinating, maybe it\u2019s I\u2019m getting older -- I find it fascinating how some look at Israel today and say its success was inevitable. Why didn\u2019t everyone understand this was just inevitable? But at the outset it was anything but inevitable. It was the opposite of inevitable. Israel\u2019s very survival was against all odds. But thankfully Israel was blessed with a founding generation that understood exactly what it took to overcome those odds. So many of that generation, because of the people of the United States, I have the great honor of personally meeting and getting to know. I did not know David Ben Gurion, but I knew all but one -- every Prime Minister since that time.President Peres, you and Prime Minister Sharon are part of one of the most remarkable founding generations in the history not of this nation, but of any nation. Historians will look back and say, but for -- but for -- the rare and unique men and women at that moment, but for that it\u2019s hard to see how we\u2019d be standing here on this day -- leaders like David Ben Gurion, Golda Meir, Menachem Begin, Yitzhak Rabin, the list goes on, and you, Mr. President, you all had one thing in common from an outside observer\u2019s perspective, despite your political differences, it was that you knew in your bones, as one Israeli Prime Minister told me over 35 years ago when I was opining of the difficulty Israel faced surrounded by hostile neighbors at the time, looked at me and said, Senator, don\u2019t worry. We Jews have a secret weapon in our struggle in the region.We have nowhere else to go.That realization, it seems to me, is what energized your entire generation of leadership. I believe that\u2019s one of the reasons by Arik Sharon and so many others fought so hard their whole lives.Prime Minister Sharon was not only loved by the Jewish people, he not only loved them -- the Jewish people -- but he loved the land of Israel. Not just the idea of it, but the actual land itself. Born on a farm, about to be buried on a farm, a ranch, I remember one of the meetings I had with him. It was a somewhat heated, and he had his maps. And he spread them out in his office again. And I somewhat irreverently said, Mr. Prime Minister -- I said, do you want me to do it, or are you going to do it? Because I had heard his presentation many times. And in the midst of it, he looked at me, and he said, let me tell you about the new calf that I just got on my ranch. And he started talking about a calf.Ladies and gentlemen, the Book of Genesis says, \u201cArise and walk the length and breadth of the land.\u201d Arik Sharon did just that. He tilled it as a farmer. He fought for it as a soldier. He knew every hilltop and valley -- every inch of the land. As I said, he loved his maps. He used to come to the meetings with maps of the land rolled up under each arm. They were always maps.I\u2019m reminded -- my mother\u2019s blessed memory, I\u2019m reminded of -- if you\u2019ll forgive me -- an Irish poet, an Irish writer. I\u2019m sure Prime Minister Blair will forgive me. That Irish writer was James Joyce. And he said, \u201cWhen I die, Dublin will be written on my heart.\u201d I am absolutely sure the land of Israel, the Negev is etched in Arik Sharon\u2019s soul as it was written on Joyce\u2019s heart.And the defining attributes of this great man\u2019s character -- passion for the Jewish people, physical and political courage, and love of this land -- they have all played out on the canvas of the State of Israel\u2019s historic trajectory.Arik Sharon\u2019s journey and the journey of the State of Israel are inseparable. They are woven together, in war, in politics, in diplomacy.Toward the end of his life, he said, I\u2019ve been everywhere. I\u2019ve met kings, queens, presidents. \u201cI\u2019ve been around the world. I have one thing that I would like to do: to try to reach peace.\u201dWe\u2019ll never know what the ultimate arc of Arik Sharon\u2019s life would have been had he been physically able to pursue his stated goal.

And many of my fellow Americans, some of whom are here, feel that same sense of loss.</p><p>I say to Prime Minister Sharon\u2019s beloved and devoted sons, Omri and Gilad, and the entire family, particularly the sons who spent so much time caring for their father in the last few years, it\u2019s a great honor you\u2019ve afforded me on behalf of my country to bring the sympathies of the President of the United States and the American people on this occasion.</p><p>To you, to Prime Minister Netanyahu and the government of Israel, to President Peres, and to the grieving men and women of the nation of Israel, but most particularly to his beloved IDF, his fellow warriors, I fear an attempt to capture him and what he stood for is beyond my capabilities. I knew him for over 30 years. He was not only a powerful man, he was a powerfully built man. And as a young senator, when you first met him you could not help but understand, as they say in the military, this man had a command presence. He filled the room.</p><p>The first time I was invited to his office, he said to me -- and I remember thinking, is he serious? -- he said, Senator, you are mostly welcome. I didn\u2019t know if it was a matter of something being lost in translation or whether he was pulling my leg, as we say in the States, until I spent a few moments with him and realized how incredible his hospitality was. But when the topic of Israel\u2019s security arose, which it always, always, always did in my many meetings over the years with him, you immediately understood how he acquired, as the speakers referenced, the nickname \u201cBulldozer.\u201d He was indomitable.</p><p>Like all historic leaders, Prime Minister Sharon was a complex man about whom, as you\u2019ve already heard from his colleagues, who engendered strong opinions from everyone. But like all historic leaders, all real leaders, he had a North Star that guided him -- a North Star from which he never, in my observation, never deviated. His North Star was the survival of the State of Israel and the Jewish people, wherever they resided.</p><p>In talking about his spiritual attachment to the land of Israel back in an interview in the late \u201890s, he said, and I quote, \u201cBefore and above all else, I am a Jew. My thinking is dominated by the Jews\u2019 future in 30 years, in 300 years, in a thousand years. That\u2019s what preoccupies and interests me first and foremost.\u201d And because he possessed such incredible physical courage -- and I would add political courage -- he never, never, never deviated from that preoccupation and interest, as he referred to it. It was his life\u2019s work that even someone on the shores hundreds of -- thousands of miles from here could see, could smell, could taste, could feel, and when you were in his presence there was never, never any doubt about it.</p><p>The physical courage he had to lead men straight into enemy lines and deep behind them. I remember, as a young senator, that iconic picture of him with that bandage around his head, standing there after a decisive victory, which seemed to symbolize, as Bibi -- as the Prime Minister said, an Israel that had reclaimed its roots of standing up and fighting, needing no help, standing on its own. The political courage it took, whether you agreed with him or not, when he told 10,000 Israelis to leave their homes in Gaza in order, from his perspective, to strengthen Israel. I can\u2019t think of much more controversial; as a student of the Jewish state, I can\u2019t think of a much more difficult and controversial decision that\u2019s been made. But he believed it and he did it.</p><p>The security of his people was always Arik\u2019s unwavering mission, an unbreakable commitment to the future of Jews, whether 30 years or 300 years from now. We have an expression in the States: never in doubt. Arik was never uncertain from my observation. I don\u2019t know him nearly as well as the Israeli people and his colleagues, but he seemed never in doubt. But there were times when he acted, and those actions earned him controversy and even condemnation. And in certain instances, American leaders -- American Presidents -- had profound differences with him, and they were never shy about stating them nor was he ever shy about stating his position. As I said, from my observation he was a complex man, but to understand him better I think it\u2019s important history will judge he also lived in complex times, in a very complex neighborhood.</p><p>Since he passed away, in the days ahead, there will be much written about the Prime Minister. And it\u2019s right for the Israeli people to reflect on all aspects of his life -- the triumphs as well as the mistakes, taking full measure of the man, the arc of his life. For I would argue the arc of his life traced the journey of the State of Israel.</p><p>And through it all, the United States whether we agreed or disagreed with a specific policy has been unflagging in its commitment to the State of Israel. We have never stepped away. We have never diminished our support. We have never failed to make Israel\u2019s case around the world. We have never failed to defend Israel\u2019s legitimacy.</p><p>And no one in any corner of this world has any doubt about where America stands with regard to Israeli security, the independent State of Israel that is the ultimate refuge for Jews wherever they are in the world. And that will never change.</p><p>As President Obama said when he was here in Jerusalem last year, and I quote, \u201cThose who adhere to the ideology of rejecting Israel\u2019s right to exist, they might as well reject the earth beneath them and the sky above because Israel is not going anywhere. So long as there is a United States of America, you are not alone.\u201d</p><p>For his part, Arik Sharon greatly valued that close friendship between the United States and Israel, and particularly during his years as prime minister, he worked hard to deepen our relationship.</p><p>I find it fascinating, maybe it\u2019s I\u2019m getting older -- I find it fascinating how some look at Israel today and say its success was inevitable. Why didn\u2019t everyone understand this was just inevitable? But at the outset it was anything but inevitable. It was the opposite of inevitable. Israel\u2019s very survival was against all odds. But thankfully Israel was blessed with a founding generation that understood exactly what it took to overcome those odds. So many of that generation, because of the people of the United States, I have the great honor of personally meeting and getting to know. I did not know David Ben Gurion, but I knew all but one -- every Prime Minister since that time.</p><p>President Peres, you and Prime Minister Sharon are part of one of the most remarkable founding generations in the history not of this nation, but of any nation. Historians will look back and say, but for -- but for -- the rare and unique men and women at that moment, but for that it\u2019s hard to see how we\u2019d be standing here on this day -- leaders like David Ben Gurion, Golda Meir, Menachem Begin, Yitzhak Rabin, the list goes on, and you, Mr. President, you all had one thing in common from an outside observer\u2019s perspective, despite your political differences, it was that you knew in your bones, as one Israeli Prime Minister told me over 35 years ago when I was opining of the difficulty Israel faced surrounded by hostile neighbors at the time, looked at me and said, Senator, don\u2019t worry. We Jews have a secret weapon in our struggle in the region.</p><p>We have nowhere else to go.</p><p>That realization, it seems to me, is what energized your entire generation of leadership. I believe that\u2019s one of the reasons by Arik Sharon and so many others fought so hard their whole lives.</p><p>Prime Minister Sharon was not only loved by the Jewish people, he not only loved them -- the Jewish people -- but he loved the land of Israel. Not just the idea of it, but the actual land itself. Born on a farm, about to be buried on a farm, a ranch, I remember one of the meetings I had with him. It was a somewhat heated, and he had his maps. And he spread them out in his office again. And I somewhat irreverently said, Mr. Prime Minister -- I said, do you want me to do it, or are you going to do it? Because I had heard his presentation many times. And in the midst of it, he looked at me, and he said, let me tell you about the new calf that I just got on my ranch. And he started talking about a calf.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, the Book of Genesis says, \u201cArise and walk the length and breadth of the land.\u201d Arik Sharon did just that. He tilled it as a farmer. He fought for it as a soldier. He knew every hilltop and valley -- every inch of the land. As I said, he loved his maps. He used to come to the meetings with maps of the land rolled up under each arm. They were always maps.</p><p>I\u2019m reminded -- my mother\u2019s blessed memory, I\u2019m reminded of -- if you\u2019ll forgive me -- an Irish poet, an Irish writer. I\u2019m sure Prime Minister Blair will forgive me. That Irish writer was James Joyce. And he said, \u201cWhen I die, Dublin will be written on my heart.\u201d I am absolutely sure the land of Israel, the Negev is etched in Arik Sharon\u2019s soul as it was written on Joyce\u2019s heart.</p><p>And the defining attributes of this great man\u2019s character -- passion for the Jewish people, physical and political courage, and love of this land -- they have all played out on the canvas of the State of Israel\u2019s historic trajectory.</p><p>Arik Sharon\u2019s journey and the journey of the State of Israel are inseparable. They are woven together, in war, in politics, in diplomacy.</p><p>Toward the end of his life, he said, I\u2019ve been everywhere. I\u2019ve met kings, queens, presidents. \u201cI\u2019ve been around the world. I have one thing that I would like to do: to try to reach peace.\u201d</p><p>We\u2019ll never know what the ultimate arc of Arik Sharon\u2019s life would have been had he been physically able to pursue his stated goal. That will be for historians to speculate and debate. But we do know this: As prime minister, he surprised many. I\u2019ve been told that, in reflecting on the difference between how he viewed things as a general and as prime minister, he would paraphrase an Israeli song lyric that said, things you see from here, look different from over there. What would have -- what would they have looked like had he lived in good health and led those eight years?</p><p>He left us too soon, but the work of trying to reach peace continues. And to quote Shakespeare: He was a man, take him all in all, we shall not look upon his like again.</p><p>May the bond between Israel and the United States never, ever be broken. </p></article>&#13;\n\t\t\t\t</div></body></html>"}, {"source": "http://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/US.xml", "text": "U.S.|National Briefing | West California: Mayor\u2019s Vehicle Strikes Pedestrian in Los Angeles By THE ASSOCIATED PRESSJAN. 15, 2014 A Los Angeles Police Department vehicle carrying Mayor Eric Garcetti struck a pedestrian on Tuesday in downtown Los Angeles.

Photograph: Rob Stothard/Getty Images To the peal of church bells, and with more than a thousand mourners marching behind it, a coffin carrying the body of Mikhailo Zhyznevsky was borne through the streets of Kiev on Sunday. Zhyznevsky, a Belarusian who lived in Ukraine, was one of at least three victims of clashes between police and protesters last Wednesday. He died of gunshot wounds.The sombre procession came as the three political leaders who have become the de facto leaders of the protests pondered a surprise offer of concessions extended to them on Saturday by the president, Viktor Yanukovych. As the tense standoff between protest barricades and riot police continued in Kiev, and unrest spread to the rest of the country, the president offered a wide range of concessions at negotiations with the leaders.He promised Arseniy Yatsenyuk, of the jailed former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko's Fatherland party, the prime minister's job, while the former boxer Vitali Klitschko was offered a deputy prime minister post. Yanukovych also suggested making a number of legislative and constitutional amendments during a special emergency parliament session on Tuesday.The opposition leaders have reacted cautiously to the proposals, rejecting them but saying they are open for further negotiation. The mood on Independence Square is that nothing short of snap presidential elections will be enough to disperse the crowds from central Kiev and calm the tension, and the political leaders fear that if they do accept any other deal, they will lose the protest mandate, and harm their own political chances.Yevgeniya, a 68-year-old from Kiev who was on Independence Square, said: \"We know what this president is like. Power sharing won't work. It will be a trap. He has to go. Nothing else will do.\"She said the violent clashes that broke out last week worried her, but were a sign of desperation: \"They are young lads and of course they have hot heads. But it's the president's fault that it has come to this. It took people dying for him to listen to us.\"In recent days, the problems for Yanukovych have intensified as the protest movement has spread from Kiev to more than a dozen regional cities, with crowds storming regional administration buildings and in some cases building barricades around them. On Sunday this new phenomenon spread to a number of cities in the east of the country, traditionally the president's stronghold.There were also further clashes in Kiev itself during the early hours of Sunday morning, as protesters moved to storm the Ukraine House, a huge convention centre that was built to house a Soviet-era museum to Vladimir Lenin. A group of interior ministry troops were resting inside the building, and amid rumours that they were preparing to launch an attack on the protest barricades, the decision was taken to storm the building.There were tense scenes as rows of well-organised youths, clad in makeshift body armour and wielding clubs, baseball bats and in one case a weaponised garden trowel advanced on the building. Fireworks were launched at the entrance, windows smashed, and some protesters attempted to lob molotov cocktails, but were restrained by fellow protesters. In the end, a human corridor was made for the troops to leave the building, which they did after several hours of tense standoff in which there were repeated rumours that the government might launch an attack to free the besieged conscripts. Klitschko arrived on the scene and negotiated the exit of the troops, who left the building at around 4am local time.The huge conference hall was quickly occupied by the protesters and became another building in central Kiev under their control. On Sunday, the upper floors were occupied by sleeping protesters, while volunteers drove vans of food to the door and field kitchens were set up inside serving sandwiches and hot tea.Down the street by the Dynamo Kiev football stadium, where the fatal clashes occurred last week, protesters have constructed huge barricades made of sandbags filled with snow, which grow bigger by the day. On Sunday there was a family atmosphere at the barricade, with groups of people, including grandmothers, banging on tin drums to create an infernal noise, and periodic shouts of: \"Glory to Ukraine,\" and \"Out with the gang!\"At the very frontline a few hardcore protesters stood guard, patrolling the soot-covered post-apocalyptic landscape, strewn with the smouldering carcasses of police buses, mangled metal and barbed wire. One of them, 34-year-old Sergei, had arrived two days earlier from the south of the country.\"I've read that people claim we are fascists,\" he said, referring to the hardline far-right groups who have indeed played a role in co-ordinating the violent part of the protest. \"We aren't fascists. We are here to stand up for the future of our country. The fascists are over there,\" he said, waving a hand towards the lines of riot police standing around 20 metres away.\"My wife wouldn't let me come to Kiev before. She said it was too dangerous.

Zhyznevsky, a Belarusian who lived in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\" title=\"More from the Guardian on Ukraine\">Ukraine</a>, was one of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/22/ukraine-opposition-leaders-meet-president-protests-fatal\" title=\"\">at least three victims</a> of clashes between police and protesters last Wednesday. He died of gunshot wounds.</p><p>The sombre procession came as the three political leaders who have become the de facto leaders of the protests pondered a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/26/ukraine-president-concessions-protests-violence\" title=\"\">surprise offer of concessions</a> extended to them on Saturday by the president, Viktor Yanukovych. As the tense standoff between <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/protest\" title=\"More from the Guardian on Protest\">protest</a> barricades and riot police continued in Kiev, and unrest spread to the rest of the country, the president offered a wide range of concessions at negotiations with the leaders.</p><p>He promised Arseniy Yatsenyuk, of the jailed former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko's Fatherland party, the prime minister's job, while the former boxer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/21/ukraine-vitali-klitschko-street-protests-corruption-interview\" title=\"\">Vitali Klitschko</a> was offered a deputy prime minister post. Yanukovych also suggested making a number of legislative and constitutional amendments during a special emergency parliament session on Tuesday.</p><p>The opposition leaders have reacted cautiously to the proposals, rejecting them but saying they are open for further negotiation. The mood on Independence Square is that nothing short of snap presidential elections will be enough to disperse the crowds from central Kiev and calm the tension, and the political leaders fear that if they do accept any other deal, they will lose the protest mandate, and harm their own political chances.</p><p>Yevgeniya, a 68-year-old from Kiev who was on Independence Square, said: \"We know what this president is like. Power sharing won't work. It will be a trap. He has to go. Nothing else will do.\"</p><p>She said the violent clashes that broke out last week worried her, but were a sign of desperation: \"They are young lads and of course they have hot heads. But it's the president's fault that it has come to this. It took people dying for him to listen to us.\"</p><p>In recent days, the problems for Yanukovych have intensified as the protest movement has spread from Kiev to more than a dozen regional cities, with crowds storming regional administration buildings and in some cases building barricades around them. On Sunday this new phenomenon spread to a number of cities in the east of the country, traditionally the president's stronghold.</p><p>There were also further clashes in Kiev itself during the early hours of Sunday morning, as protesters moved to storm the Ukraine House, a huge convention centre that was built to house a Soviet-era museum to Vladimir Lenin. A group of interior ministry troops were resting inside the building, and amid rumours that they were preparing to launch an attack on the protest barricades, the decision was taken to storm the building.</p><p>There were tense scenes as rows of well-organised youths, clad in makeshift body armour and wielding clubs, baseball bats and in one case a weaponised garden trowel advanced on the building. Fireworks were launched at the entrance, windows smashed, and some protesters attempted to lob molotov cocktails, but were restrained by fellow protesters. In the end,  a human corridor was made for the troops to leave the building, which they did after several hours of tense standoff in which there were repeated rumours that the government might launch an attack to free the besieged conscripts. Klitschko arrived on the scene and negotiated the exit of the troops, who left the building at around 4am local time.</p><p>The huge conference hall was quickly occupied by the protesters and became another building in central Kiev under their control. On Sunday, the upper floors were occupied by sleeping protesters, while volunteers drove vans of food to the door and field kitchens were set up inside serving sandwiches and hot tea.</p><p>Down the street by the Dynamo Kiev football stadium, where the fatal clashes occurred last week, protesters have constructed huge barricades made of sandbags filled with snow, which grow bigger by the day. On Sunday there was a family atmosphere at the barricade, with groups of people, including grandmothers, banging on tin drums to create an infernal noise, and periodic shouts of: \"Glory to Ukraine,\" and \"Out with the gang!\"</p><p>At the very frontline a few hardcore protesters stood guard, patrolling the soot-covered post-apocalyptic landscape, strewn with the smouldering carcasses of police buses, mangled metal and barbed wire. One of them, 34-year-old Sergei, had arrived two days earlier from the south of the country.</p><p>\"I've read that people claim we are fascists,\" he said, referring to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/23/ukrainian-far-right-groups-violence-kiev-pravy-sektor\" title=\"\">hardline far-right groups who have indeed played a role in co-ordinating the violent part of the protest</a>. \"We aren't fascists. We are here to stand up for the future of our country. The fascists are over there,\" he said, waving a hand towards the lines of riot police standing around 20 metres away.</p><p>\"My wife wouldn't let me come to Kiev before. She said it was too dangerous. But now I've decided it's more dangerous to stay sitting at home complaining, and not fight for a better future for my wife and kids. So now I'm here. If we retreat now, we will lose everything. There can't be any compromise.

That rate is a hangover from the euro zone sovereign debt crisis, and a cultural shift has left young people less interested in driving than their parents\u2019 generation was.\u201cWe believe the market bottomed last year and the worst is behind us,\u201d said Peter Fuss, of the Ernst Young Global Automotive Center in Frankfurt. He estimated that sales this year would rise by as much as 4 percent.Consumer confidence is improving, but remains weak, he said. And he pointed out that car sales had received significant \u201cartificial\u201d support, including from manufacturer discounts and trade-in incentives for older cars in Spain. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait for 2015 to see what true demand is,\u201d he said.Even with a rebound in 2014, \u201cthe crisis will still be felt for a long time,\u201d Carlos Da Silva, an analyst at IHS, wrote in a research note. \u201cTo put it directly, we do not think that the E.U. market will return to its 2007 peak ... ever.\u201dThe association\u2019s data showed that Volkswagen, the largest European automaker, managed to hold the line with a slight decline in 2013, thanks to strong sales of its Seat and Skoda brands.But PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, the Continent\u2019s second-largest carmaker, had a steady slide in sales. The French company is currently negotiating with the French government and Dongfeng Motor, a state-owned Chinese company, for a major infusion of capital to help it diversify beyond Europe and invest in new technology.Its French rival, Renault, managed a small increase in sales, thanks to the runaway performance of its low-cost Dacia brand, which posted a 23.3 percent gain in 2013 \u2014 by far the biggest increase of any brand in Europe.Other strong gains were posted by Mazda and Jaguar, while Chevrolet and Lexus had among the steeper declines.General Motors and Ford Motor had another tough year in Europe, even as their business improved in the United States and in other overseas markets. Fiat, the Italian automaker that is taking full ownership of Chrysler, posted a 7.1 percent decline.There was significant variation between markets, as well. Britain\u2019s was the strongest of the major European Union nations, growing nearly 11 percent in 2013, but that had more to do with easy financing terms than the country\u2019s relatively strong economy. Spain, despite suffering from depression-level unemployment, managed 3.3 percent growth on the basis of government-sponsored trade-in incentives. Sales in Germany, the engine of the European economy, slid 4.2 percent.BMW\u2019s mainstay premium lineup was almost unchanged, but its overall sales dropped as its Mini brand faltered.Mr. Fuss said a crucial question in the new year would be whether President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s new economic policy initiatives would bring down the French jobless rate and reinvigorate a market that shrank by 5.7 percent in 2013.Philippe Houchois, head of European auto industry research at UBS in London, said it was hard to say just how much of the year-end demand reflected artificial support and how much was real demand.\u201cWe don\u2019t really know how healthy the market is,\u201d Mr. Houchois said. But with annual sales 24 percent below the 2007 peak, he added, \u201cit has probably shrunk enough.\u201dMr. Houchois said that the biggest potential recovery was in countries like Spain and Italy that had been particularly hurt by the financial and sovereign debt crises and where demand had fallen the most. If they bounce back, he noted, that would benefit companies like Renault and Peugeot that sell the types of cars that are most popular there.", "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 09:20:55 GMT", "tags": ["Fiat SpA|FIATY|other-OTC", "Volkswagen AG|VLKAY|Other OTC", "Automobiles", "Europe", "Renault SA", "General Motors|GM|NYSE", "Ford Motor Co|F|NYSE", "Peugeot SA|PEUGY|other-OTC"], "title": "Car Sales in Europe End 2013 With a Rally", "updated": "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 09:20:55 GMT", "author": "By DAVID JOLLY", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/17/business/international/car-sales-in-europe-end-2013-with-a-rally.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "_id": 20648969, "html": "<html><body><div><article id=\"story\" class=\"story theme-main\">\n\n    <header class=\"story-header\">\n                <div class=\"story-meta\">\n                        \n            <h1 itemprop=\"headline\" class=\"story-heading\">Car Sales in Europe End 2013 With a Rally</h1>\n\n                        \n        </div>\n    </header>\n\n    \n    \n\n                \n    <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"129\" data-total-count=\"129\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">PARIS \u2014 European car sales ended 2013 on a strong note, raising hopes of a market rebound, despite another year of contraction.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"215\" data-total-count=\"344\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The annual decline of 1.7 percent last year was much smaller than analysts had anticipated after a dismal start, and the December gain of 13.3 percent from a year earlier was the biggest monthly increase since 2009.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"270\" data-total-count=\"614\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The European Union\u2019s <a title=\"European auto sales. \" href=\"http://www.acea.be/index.php/news/news_detail/passenger_car_registrations_-1.7_in_2013_13.3_in_december\">new car registrations</a>, a proxy for sales, totaled about 12 million vehicles for the year \u2014 the smallest number since 1995, when the bloc had about half as many countries, the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association reported on Thursday.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"344\" data-total-count=\"958\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Car sales have bounced back in the United States since the financial crisis and remained strong in China, but Europe has been battered by a punishingly high jobless rate.

Related Coverage Mr. Menendez received a three-page letter last week from Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq responding to his concerns and received an urgent call from the State Department on Tuesday promising a further response. Although committee officials said the answers so far do not go much further than Mr. Maliki or the administration have in the past, Mr. Menendez was convinced that they are serious about dealing with the concerns given the latest strife in Anbar Province.\u201cThe administration is now addressing concerns first raised in July that required responses before this sale could proceed,\u201d said Adam Sharon, the senator\u2019s spokesman. \u201cProvided these issues are sufficiently addressed, Chairman Menendez will be ready to move forward.\u201dThe Obama administration has proposed selling 20 to 30 of the helicopters to the Iraqi government, but, because it could take years for them to be built, it has also asked to lease up to 10 aircraft in the interim. Administration officials said the Apaches could be useful in targeting fighters affiliated with Al Qaeda like those who have taken over parts of Fallujah and Ramadi in recent days. But even if Mr. Menendez dropped his objections, it could take until April to deliver them, and officials noted that pilots would still need to be trained.Moreover, other senators remain concerned. \u201cI think we have to be very careful,\u201d said Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee. \u201cAll of that could fall into the wrong hands.\u201dThe administration is separately planning to provide an additional shipment of Hellfire missiles as early as this spring, seeing them as effective at denying Al Qaeda a haven in Anbar. In addition, the administration plans to send Iraq 10 ScanEagle surveillance drones in coming weeks and 48 Raven surveillance drones later in the year. Those come on top of Aerostat surveillance balloons provided to Iraq in September and three additional Bell IA-407 helicopters sent last month.Still, even some senior Democrats who support reinforcing Iraqi troops said Mr. Maliki ultimately bore the burden for crafting a long-term political solution with Sunnis in restive Anbar Province.\u201cYou could tactically go in with enough force to displace Al Qaeda, but the long-term success is based on the politics,\u201d said Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, a senior Democrat on the Armed Services Committee. \u201cMaliki has to help himself out.\u201d", "published": "Thu, 09 Jan 2014 04:24:48 GMT", "tags": ["Defense and Military Forces", "Menendez, Bob", "United States Politics and Government", "Helicopters", "Maliki, Nuri Kamal al-", "Iraq"], "title": "Senator Signals Support for Sending Helicopters to Iraq", "updated": "Thu, 09 Jan 2014 04:24:48 GMT", "author": "By PETER BAKER and ERIC SCHMITT", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/09/us/politics/senator-signals-support-for-sending-helicopters-to-iraq.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "_id": 23337828, "html": "<html><body><div><article id=\"story\" class=\"story theme-main\">\n\n    <header class=\"story-header\">\n                <div class=\"story-meta\">\n                        \n            <h1 itemprop=\"headline\" class=\"story-heading\">Senator Signals Support for Sending Helicopters to Iraq</h1>\n\n                        \n        </div>\n    </header>\n\n    \n    \n\n                \n    <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"260\" data-total-count=\"260\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">WASHINGTON \u2014 A powerful Senate Democrat signaled Wednesday that he might allow the transfer of AH-64 Apache helicopters to Iraq as the government in Baghdad struggles to recapture key territory seized by Islamic extremists in the western part of the country.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"367\" data-total-count=\"627\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The senator, Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has blocked the lease and sale of the powerful attack helicopters for months while seeking assurances that Iraq would not use them to attack civilians and that the government in Baghdad would take steps to stop Iran from using Iraqi airspace to ship arms to Syria\u2019s military.</p>    <aside class=\"marginalia related-coverage-marginalia\" data-marginalia-type=\"sprinkled\">\n        \n            <header>\n        <h2 class=\"module-heading\">\n                            Related Coverage\n                    </h2>\n    </header>\n\n        \n\n    </aside>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"478\" data-total-count=\"1105\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Mr. Menendez received a three-page letter last week from Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq responding to his concerns and received an urgent call from the State Department on Tuesday promising a further response.

But even if Mr. Menendez dropped his objections, it could take until April to deliver them, and officials noted that pilots would still need to be trained.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"230\" data-total-count=\"2164\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Moreover, other senators remain concerned. \u201cI think we have to be very careful,\u201d said Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee. \u201cAll of that could fall into the wrong hands.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"480\" data-total-count=\"2644\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The administration is separately planning to provide an additional shipment of Hellfire missiles as early as this spring, seeing them as effective at denying Al Qaeda a haven in Anbar. In addition, the administration plans to send Iraq 10 ScanEagle surveillance drones in coming weeks and 48 Raven surveillance drones later in the year.

But when only one side puts a candidate forward, he or she sucks all the oxygen out of the room.\u201dThat was certainly the opinion of the BJP, which claimed the decision taken by the ruling party in the world\u2019s largest democracy exposed a defeatist attitude.\u201cThis is exasperation from Congress which knows they are going to lose the election and therefore want to save [Mr Gandhi] for the next election,\u201d said Prakash Javadekar, a BJP MP and party spokesman.The Congress party, led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, has run India\u2019s central government for the past ten years. Having been reelected comfortably in 2009, a series of corruption scandals and mounting concern about the ability of Mr Singh to bring genuine change, have led to considerably strong anti-incumbency mood in the country.Mr Modi, who has served three terms as chief minister of the western state of Gujarat, has in recent months been riding on this wave and attracting widespread attention and support. Reports suggest that in private, senior Congress officials have accepted they are heading for a defeat.Yet in the last few weeks, a new, surprise element has been added to the equation. The grass-roots, anti-corruption Aam Aadmi Party, or Common Man Party, (AAP) stormed to power in local Delhi elections in December, and have made a late and dramatic entry to the broader political fight.From their base in the nation\u2019s capital, the leadership of the AAP is now planning to contest at least 300 of the 543 constituency battles across India. There is mounting speculation that if the AAP manages to secure a couple of dozen seats it could take the wind from Mr Modi\u2019s sails.The fallout from the decision not to name Mr Gandhi as Congress\u2019s official candidate remains unclear. Observers have long commented on Mr Gandhi\u2019s apparent reluctance to step forward and take charge of a ministry, or else a state government.As a result there has always been a doubt as to whether or not he truly desires to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps and become Prime Minister. Many wish his sister, Priyanka, stepped forward and joined the fray.Following the decision, party spokesmen were obliged to fall back on the suggestion that it was a tradition not to name a candidate ahead of an election. \u201cMrs Gandhi said this is not the party\u2019s tradition. Just because some party has declared the PM candidate, does not mean that Congress will do the same,\u201d spokesman Janardan Dwivedi told reporters.Several commentators said they were struck by Mrs Gandhi\u2019s late-minute intervention to block a move to name her son as the official candidate. \u201cIt is like a family soap opera or else a family tragedy, in the classic sense, playing out before you,\u201d said one Western diplomat, who asked not to be named.Many believe the decision will make little practical difference to the way the election battle plays out.\u201cI don\u2019t think it makes much of a difference. The Congress is staring at a mountain. Irrespective of who wins and how many seats Mr Modi and Mr Kejriwal may or may not win, the Congress is going to lose heavily,\u201d said Ashok Malik, a writer and analyst.He added: \u201cNot projecting Rahul as the official candidate is probably an attempt to protect him from the likely election result, and make it easier to blame Manmohan Singh.\u201dDuring her speech on Friday, Mrs Gandhi, the widow of Rajiv Gandhi, who was killed by an assassin in southern India in 1989 during an election campaign, blasted the opposition.She reserved particular ire for Mr Modi, who has been accused of failing to stop a massacre of hundreds of Muslims in Gujarat in 2002, and said the right-wing Hindu nationalist would represent a sharp break with the country\u2019s traditions.\u201c[The election] will be a battle for the preservation of our age-old secular tradition,\u201d she said, according to the AFP news agency. \u201c[India is a fabric] whose vibrant beauty can be seen only as whole, a single fabric much bigger than the sum of all the strands.\u201d", "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2014 16:45:42 GMT", "tags": ["Asia"], "title": "Battle lines drawn as India's ruling party fails to declare Rahul Gandhi as its official candidate for prime minister", "updated": "Fri, 17 Jan 2014 16:45:42 GMT", "author": null, "url": "http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/266/f/3503/s/360a78b7/sc/11/l/0L0Sindependent0O0Cnews0Cworld0Casia0Cbattle0Elines0Edrawn0Eas0Eindias0Eruling0Eparty0Efails0Eto0Edeclare0Erahul0Egandhi0Eas0Eits0Eofficial0Ecandidate0Efor0Eprime0Eminister0E90A680A550Bhtml/story01.htm", "_id": 24719749, "html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"body \">\n<p>Just three months before India is expected to go to the polls in what is becoming perhaps the most bitterly fought election for years, Mr Gandhi addressed thousands of his party\u2019s members to declare: \u201cWe will go into battle knowing what we stand for.\u201d</p><p>Mr Gandhi, the son of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and great grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru, will lead India\u2019s oldest party\u2019s campaign against the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its charismatic but controversial leader Narendra Modi.</p><p>But after months, if not years, of speculation that he would be officially named the party\u2019s candidate for prime minister, it was announced late on Thursday evening that his mother, party president Sonia Gandhi, had vetoed the plan.</p><p>\u201cWe took a decision on Rahul yesterday and that decision is final,\u201d Mrs Gandhi declared to the same meeting in Delhi on Friday \u201cWe meet today to signal that Congress is ready and prepared for the battle ahead.\u201d</p><p>The decision by the Congress not to name Mr Gandhi as its candidate was widely interpreted as the clearest sign yet that the party does not expect to do well in the polls, due to take place before May, and is seeking to limit damage to the already-fraying Gandhi brand.</p><p>\u201cMany top leaders and rank-and-file members have been urging the party to formally project Rahul in order to blunt the impact of Narendra Modi,\u201d said Milan Vaishnav of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.</p><p>\u201cIt appears Sonia Gandhi does not share this view, in keeping with past party tradition.

They also serve as a postal address: Letters can be inserted through an outer slot. In Arroios, a neighborhood of Lisbon, stands a set of 12 metal lockers. Surrounded by old trees and newly planted bushes, the lockers represent a pilot project designed by Portuguese architect Duarte Paiva as a way to safeguard the possessions of the homeless. Skip to next paragraph Subscribe Today to the Monitor Click Here for your FREE 30 DAYS ofThe Christian Science MonitorWeekly Digital Edition The shining yellow cabinets also serve as a postal address: Letters can be inserted through an outer slot. Inside, each has three shelves and a place to hang clothes.Among the beneficiaries is Jorge Toledo. He was the first to receive a key to a locker on Oct. 17, 2013, designated by the United Nations as the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. Until recently in Locker No. 1 he had put only his \"main treasures\": photos of his two daughters and a document proving that he is a certified electrician. Now he also stores some clothes, a backpack with other garments, a pair of sneakers, and a tool bag. Like Mr. Toledo, other less fortunate people use the lockers to store their belongings, which they previously dragged up and down the streets of Lisbon \u2013 \"the city of seven hills\" \u2013 in boxes, bags, or supermarket shopping carts.Now, as winter sets in, they feel protected against robberies and rain.\"The idea is to restore the sense of responsibility of the homeless, reinforce their self-esteem, and reduce the feeling of exclusion and loneliness,\" explains Mr. Paiva, who in 2007 founded the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Conversa Amiga (ACA, or Friendly Talk Association).The \u20ac11,635 ($15,800) locker project was funded by the Lisbon municipal government. Paiva would like to start similar locker projects all over Portugal and in other European cities \u2013 and even bring his idea to America.In order to obtain and keep using a locker a homeless person has to obey several rules, which include maintaining regular contact with the ACA street team, and promising to help keep the area around the lockers clean and not use them to store illicit substances.In Arroios, the lockers were placed close to a church and police station. It was on the stairs of St. George Church that Toledo used to sleep before being offered shelter in an old van. Sliding open a door of the van's cargo area, he proudly shows his mattress with its crumpled sheets.Toledo was born in Ilha Terceira, one of the nine islands of the Azores archipelago, an autonomous region of Portugal. His late father, of whom he speaks with visible pride (\"Thanks to him, I finished secondary school\"), was an aircraft maintenance employee at a US air base there.Toledo's parents eventually rented their house to a US military officer and moved with their four children (two boys and two girls) to the Azores city of Angra do Hero\u00edsmo. Coincidentally, Paiva was born there in 1981.But Paiva and Toledo never met in the Azores. They first encountered each other in Lisbon in 2010. One year later, the architect was awarded a community prize from Do Something (Portugal), a US organization supporting the charitable projects of younger adults.Paiva had started volunteering at age 14. His first effort, with the cooperation of firefighters, was \"to save a cat trapped on the top of a telephone pole,\" he says. Instead of being grateful, the animal acted with fury toward his benefactor. That taught Paiva an early lesson.\"This also happens with homeless people \u2013 not all of them are docile,\" he says. \"At daytime, they are frequently neglected; at night, when helpers come, they can be aggressive just to reassert their dignity.\"We are not taking care of a homogenous population. There are so many different cases that it is wrong to address them\" as though they are all alike, he says.The ACA has a yearly budget of around \u20ac20,000 ($27,000) and about 70 regular volunteers. During 2012 it managed to assist more than 6,100 people \u2013 not all of them homeless.On World Diabetes Day (Nov. 14) a group of ACA volunteers, among them a doctor and a nurse, taught a group of men and women at a senior center the best way to care for their feet. The local Roman Catholic Church, which runs the senior center, is one of 17 ACA partners.Elsewhere, in a poor neighborhood two young women from ACA were helping a group of children do their homework. Their parents, most of them destitute, pay only a small fee.Paiva's dedication to the homeless is related to his childhood in the Azores.\"I used to play by inventing and creating things,\" he says. \"My family is not rich, and I had to struggle to have what I wanted, whether it was a toy or a university degree.\"When he was 9 years old, he offered bread to an impoverished neighbor, who rejected the gift. Paiva wondered why.The answer arrived in 2005. It was Christmas Eve. He was delivering food and clothes to the homeless and was surprised when they told him what they needed most: someone to listen to them. They needed a friend.\"My thoughts were, 'I do not have the means to offer a house to everyone, but I can share a portion of my time,' \" Paiva says. \"Then, I created an Internet page, Um sem-abrigo; Um amigo [\"One homeless; One friend\"]. Since the beginning our purpose remains the same: to diminish the isolation and marginalization of vulnerable individuals and groups.\"He started by offering hot tea to homeless people, still a trademark of ACA volunteers. Every fortnight a different person in each ACA team prepares a large container of hot tea and serves it in paper cups.One of the six main locations served by ACA is Gare do Oriente. At least 30 homeless people, mostly men, sleep on the cold stone benches of this central railway station, which connects the north and south of Portugal.All of them are treated like relatives by the ACA helpers, who are easily identified by their green vests.On a Saturday night, Hugo Martins, a young doctor who has donated backpacks with simple medical supplies for the homeless, gives two octogenarians medical advice. One of them, a widower, owns a house but moved to the station to sleep after the love of his life died five years ago.The ACA focuses on basic needs, such as offering medical treatment free of charge, obtaining documents, or arranging for a state pension. It does not distribute soup or blankets since many other groups do that.Working with the homeless is a remarkable personal experience, Dr. Martins says. \"I no longer deal solely with diseases but with human beings, who make a better person out of me,\" he says.One man always waiting for the ACA volunteers, Armando Barbosa, is unemployed. But thanks to ACA he is now receiving a monthly social services allowance and learning English, and he expects to take the test to become a truck or bus driver. He still goes to the Gare do Oriente train station, where he slept for three months, but now it is only to talk. Toledo, who received Locker No. 1, says he's never felt \"so happy.\" After two failed marriages and the loss of his father and of two friends, he arrived in Lisbon in 2009, dependent on drugs and expecting to die. \"I brought \u20ac22,000 [$30,000] and I spent all of it in less than six months on cocaine and parties,\" he recalls.Now, sitting in a coffee shop and bakery where he helps out doing a bit of everything in exchange for meals, Toledo smiles at Paiva. He concedes that ACA is \"reintegrating him into society.\" He is saving his money for a journey across North Africa.Paiva, his friend, is pleased.\"If I cannot change the whole world overnight, I am sure that I can change the street where I live,\" he says. \"Probably, I will never [build] big buildings. But if someone leaves me on an isolated island I will be able to erect a city with [only] a few sticks and ropes.\"\u2022 For more information, visit http://acamiga\u200b.wix.com/aca-pt or https://www.facebook.com/AssociacaoConversaAmiga (both sites are in Portuguese).Help the homelessUniversalGiving helps people give to and volunteer for top-performing charitable organizations worldwide.

They needed a friend.</p><p>\"My thoughts were, 'I do not have the means to offer a house to everyone, but I can share a portion of my time,' \" Paiva says. \"Then, I created an Internet page, Um sem-abrigo; Um amigo [\"One homeless; One friend\"]. Since the beginning our purpose remains the same: to diminish the isolation and marginalization of vulnerable individuals and groups.\"</p><p>He started by offering hot tea to homeless people, still a trademark of ACA volunteers. Every fortnight a different person in each ACA team prepares a large container of hot tea and serves it in paper cups.</p><p>One of the six main locations served by ACA is Gare do Oriente. At least 30 homeless people, mostly men, sleep on the cold stone benches of this central railway station, which connects the north and south of Portugal.</p><p>All of them are treated like relatives by the ACA helpers, who are easily identified by their green vests.</p><p>On a Saturday night, Hugo Martins, a young doctor who has donated backpacks with simple medical supplies for the homeless, gives two octogenarians medical advice. One of them, a widower, owns a house but moved to the station to sleep after the love of his life died five years ago.</p><p>The ACA focuses on basic needs, such as offering medical treatment free of charge, obtaining documents, or arranging for a state pension. It does not distribute soup or blankets since many other groups do that.</p><p>Working with the homeless is a remarkable personal experience, Dr. Martins says. \"I no longer deal solely with diseases but with human beings, who make a better person out of me,\" he says.</p><p>One man always waiting for the ACA volunteers, Armando Barbosa, is unemployed. But thanks to ACA he is now receiving a monthly social services allowance and learning English, and he expects to take the test to become a truck or bus driver. He still goes to the Gare do Oriente train station, where he slept for three months, but now it is only to talk.</p>\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n<p>Toledo, who received Locker No. 1, says he's never felt \"so happy.\" After two failed marriages and the loss of his father and of two friends, he arrived in Lisbon in 2009, dependent on drugs and expecting to die. \"I brought \u20ac22,000 [$30,000] and I spent all of it in less than six months on cocaine and parties,\" he recalls.</p><p>Now, sitting in a coffee shop and bakery where he helps out doing a bit of everything in exchange for meals, Toledo smiles at Paiva. He concedes that ACA is \"reintegrating him into society.\" He is saving his money for a journey across North Africa.</p><p>Paiva, his friend, is pleased.</p><p>\"If I cannot change the whole world overnight, I am sure that I can change the street where I live,\" he says. \"Probably, I will never [build] big buildings. But if someone leaves me on an isolated island I will be able to erect a city with [only] a few sticks and ropes.\"</p><p><em>\u2022 For more information, visit <a href=\"http://acamiga%C3%A2%C2%80%C2%8B.wix.com/aca-pt\" target=\"_self\">http://acamiga\u200b.wix.com/aca-pt</a> or <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AssociacaoConversaAmiga\" target=\"_self\">https://www.facebook.com/AssociacaoConversaAmiga</a> (both sites are in Portuguese).</em></p><a name=\"eztoc17833381_1\" id=\"eztoc17833381_1\"/><h2><b>Help the homeless</b></h2><p><a href=\"http://universalgiving.org\" target=\"_blank\"><b>UniversalGiving</b></a> helps people give to and volunteer for top-performing charitable organizations worldwide.

Photograph: Paula Bronstein/Getty Images Anti-government demonstrators have descended on dozens of polling stations in Thailand to stop advance voting for next week's general elections, chaining gates shut, threatening voters and preventing hundreds of thousands of people from casting ballots.A protest faction leader was fatally shot in a confrontation near a polling centre that also left 11 people wounded, and isolated street brawls broke out in several parts of Bangkok.The chaos underscored the precariousness of Thailand's fragile democracy, and the increasing weakness of the elected administration of the prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra. Yingluck had called the vote on 2 February in a failed bid to ease months of street protests, but police did not disperse the crowds because of longstanding orders to avert violence, which many fear would give the powerful army reason to stage a coup.Although most polling stations in Bangkok and many in the opposition stronghold in the south were forced to close, voting proceeded largely unhindered in the rest of the country. Still, the upheaval proved that demonstrators struggling to overthrow Yingluck have the ability to disrupt the main vote next week, and the country's electoral commission is unlikely to stand in their way.The commission, which agrees with protesters that the poll should be delayed, is legally mandated to ensure registered voters are able to cast ballots safely. But on Sunday, its members \"just sat down and watched this thing collapse around them\", said Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.The commission is supposed to be a neutral body, but critics have accused its members of taking sides. Its top executive has posed for at least one smiling photo with demonstrators, and its officials failed to denounce a violent effort by protesters to disrupt candidate registration in December.Similarly on Sunday, the commission issued no public condemnation of attempts to derail voting. Sunai said members did not call on security forces to defend the ballot.Analysts say that is because courts and the country's independent oversight agencies are largely aligned against the current government in collusion with the army, royalists and powerful businessmen. Yingluck is facing several legal cases that could end with her or her party being banished from governing because of alleged corruption or violations of the constitution.Suthida Sungkhapunthu, a 28-year-old office worker, said she turned back from one polling station after reading news of the day's mayhem on her phone.\"I saw this coming but I'm still quite disappointed,\" she said, calling the protesters \"undemocratic\" as she watched a mob surrounding her polling station a block away. \"It's my constitutional right\" to vote, she said.The protest movement, known as the People's Democratic Reform Committee, had pledged not to obstruct the poll, saying its supporters would only stand outside to express their views and urge people not to vote. The protest spokesman Akanat Promphan told the Associated Press that those who had locked the gates of polling stations had \"acted on their own\", but he did not criticise them and said the decision to close stations was made by election commission officials.The protesters' effort, however, appeared to have been widely co-ordinated. Across Bangkok, demonstrators waving the Thai flag physically blocked electoral officials, ballot boxes and voters from getting inside polling centres. Some did vote, but officials ultimately shut 48 of the city's 50 voting stations. Eleven more shut in the south, bringing the total number closed to 59 out of 152 nationwide, authorities said.Scuffles broke out in some areas, and Bangkok's emergency medical centre said at least one person had been killed and 11 wounded in a clash near a polling station in south-east Bangkok. Sutin Tharatin, a protest faction leader, was shot in the head by political rivals, according to police.Sunai said some protesters had threatened and intimidated would-be voters, and in at least one case had attempted to strangle a man.\"You cannot call this peaceful,\" he said. \"It's a sad day for democracy when the right to vote, which is a basic requisite, is assaulted by a political movement that claims to be striving for reform and people's empowerment.

Pike, 92, Dies; Long Island Congressman Took On C.I.A. Representative Otis G. Pike, a Long Island Democrat and chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, in 1975. George Tames/The New York Times Otis G. Pike, a longtime congressman from New York who spearheaded an inquiry in the 1970s into accusations that the intelligence establishment had abused its power, died on Monday in Vero Beach, Fla. He was 92. His daughter, Lois Pike Eyre, said he had entered a hospice a week ago.Over 18 years in the House of Representatives as a Democrat from a heavily Republican district on Long Island, Mr. Pike styled himself an uninhibited, independent thinker, lashing out, for example, against military profligacy.In 1975, he became chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, which began examining suspicions that the Central Intelligence Agency had had its hand in coups in Chile and other countries and was spying on American citizens. The inquiry paralleled one in the Senate; they were the first in which Congress looked into allegations of abuse by the C.I.A.Mr. Pike maintained that the security agencies were inept bureaucracies that left the country vulnerable. \u201cIf an attack were to be launched on America in the very near future,\u201d he said in late 1975, \u201cit is my belief that America would not know that the attack was about to be launched.\u201dThe Pike committee hearings were tempestuous and resulted in a lengthy report demanding greater congressional oversight of intelligence operations. However, the full House voted to keep the so-called Pike Report secret. It is probably best remembered for being disclosed by Daniel Schorr of CBS News and then published in The Village Voice.Greater attention was paid to the findings of the Senate committee, which was led by Frank Church, a Democrat of Idaho. Some of its recommended reforms were carried out. Otis Grey Pike was born on Aug. 31, 1921, in Riverhead, N.Y., on the eastern edge of Long Island. His parents died when he was still a small boy, and he was raised by relatives. He enrolled at Princeton University, then interrupted his studies to join the Marines. During World War II he was a fighter pilot in the Pacific, flying 120 missions. He completed his degree after his discharge.Politics captured his imagination when he was 14, he said, after he had learned from his sister about a family who owned a large farm but had nothing for Sunday dinner but boiled potatoes. After graduating from Columbia University Law School in 1948, he practiced law in his hometown and became a justice of the peace. His first campaign for a House seat, in 1958, failed, but he was elected two years later, despite being a Democrat in a Republican district. He once quipped, \u201cI\u2019ve always said I\u2019m surrounded on three sides by water and on the fourth by Republicans.\u201d A tall, wavy-haired man who wore bow ties exclusively, he attracted attention in 1967 when he complained that the Defense Department was paying absurd amounts of money for spare parts like nuts and washers obtainable at a small fraction of the cost through mail-order catalogs. Displaying one part at a news conference, he said, \u201cThis is called precision shafting.\u201d The Pentagon ultimately revamped its buying protocol. In 1969, Mr. Pike conducted a House subcommittee investigation into the seizure of the intelligence ship Pueblo by North Koreans, concluding that \u201cserious deficiencies\u201d existed in the United States military command structure. In all, Mr. Pike served for nine terms before choosing not to run for re-election in 1978. He quoted the soccer player Pel\u00e9: \u201cA man can\u2019t play one game all his life.\u201d After leaving Congress, he wrote a column for the Newhouse Newspapers for 20 years.Mr. Pike\u2019s first wife, Doris Orth, died in 1996, and a son, Robert, died in 2010. In addition to his daughter, he is survived by his second wife, Barbe Bonjour Pike; a son, Douglas; and two grandchildren.One of his memorable achievements was when he thwarted a bill with a single comical speech on the House floor. The bill would have awarded $14 million in flight pay to admirals and generals who spent their time not in cockpits but sitting at desks.Standing up on the House floor to criticize the legislation, Mr. Pike spoke with his arms spread and swaying like the wings of a plane, as if he were flying. He brought up the worrisome perils of an admiral spinning in his chair and soaring out a window of the Pentagon into air-traffic patterns. The speech drew laughter and applause. The bill was defeated. A version of this article appears in print on January 21, 2014, on page B7 of the New York edition with the headline: Otis Pike, 92, Congressman Who Took on C.I.A., Dies.

Vatican officials came in for an unprecedented grilling today by a United Nations committee over the Catholic Church's cover-up of decades of sexual abuse of children by clergy. Skip to next paragraph Subscribe Today to the Monitor Click Here for your FREE 30 DAYS ofThe Christian Science MonitorWeekly Digital Edition But despite familiar defenses from the Holy See concerning its role in child-abuse scandals, victims and their advocates are hopeful that the shame of being questioned in public could propel significant change within the church. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in Geneva posed charged, blunt questions to senior Vatican officials today, the first time that they had been called to defend their record on the rape of thousands of children by clergy in front of an international body. The Catholic Church ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990 but failed to provide the required progress reports for more than a decade, with victims\u2019 groups accusing the church hierarchy of fostering a culture of secrecy to hide abuse of children by priests, monks, and nuns in countries around the world, from Italy and Ireland to the US and Australia.\"Why is there no mandatory reporting to a country's judicial authorities when crimes occur?\" asked Hiranthi Wijemanne, a member of the committee. \"Taking actions against perpetrators is part of justice.\" Another member, Sara Oviedo, was equally forthright. \"The Holy See has not established any mechanism to investigate those accused of perpetrating sexual abuse, nor to prosecute them.\u201dCommittee members also asked the Vatican delegation what plans it had to collect data on clerical sex abuse, what oversight was in place for Catholic institutions such as schools and orphanages, and how it trained priests to work with minors.'The Holy See gets it'Addressing the hearing, Archbishop Silvano Tomasi, the Vatican's representative in Geneva, showed a degree of remorse, saying that \"such crimes can never be justified.\"Archbishop Charles Scicluna, a prelate from Malta who for a decade was the most senior Vatican official in charge of dealing with sexual abuse cases, acknowledged that the church had made mistakes in the past.\"The Holy See gets it, let's not say too late.... There are certainly things that need to be done differently,\" he said. \"It is not the policy of the Holy See to encourage cover-ups. Only the truth will help us move on to a situation where we can start being an example of best practice.\"But Archbishop Tomasi reiterated an argument that the Vatican has long used \u2013 that the Holy See cannot be held responsible for the actions of clergy members in countries around the world and that its remit extends only to those living and working within the Vatican City State \u2013 the tiny sovereign territory surrounded by Rome, where fewer than 40 children reside.Priests were \"not functionaries of the Vatican but citizens of their countries and fall under the jurisdiction of their own countries,\" he said.That argument was condemned as dishonest by campaigners for victims of sexual abuse, who said it was clear that the Vatican is the hub of the worldwide Catholic Church and issues directives and orders to dioceses around the globe.\u201cIt is just so disingenuous for Church officials to claim that national governments are responsible for prosecuting clergy when those same Church officials have obstructed justice, helped predator priests move jurisdictions, destroyed evidence, and paid off victims and witnesses to remain silent,\u201d says Barbara Blaine, a victim of abuse herself and the president of the US-based Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP).'Vindicated'Despite the Vatican official's familiar arguments in Geneva, some campaigners saw a glimmer of hope in the public inquiry.\u201cIt feels like a new chapter of justice and transparency has been opened,\u201d says Megan Peterson, a member of SNAP and a victim of abuse as a child in Minnesota. \u201cIt\u2019s a historic day for me.\u201dMiguel Hurtado, also from SNAP, said that in the past he and fellow campaigners had been called \u201cCatholic haters who want to destroy the Church\u201d by senior clergy. \u201cWe feel vindicated by the UN committee and we hope the Vatican will change its approach.\u201dThe UN committee, which is composed of independent experts, will issue a report on Feb. 5. Its recommendations are not binding and the committee has no ability to sanction the Vatican, but it could still spur the Vatican into action, activists said.\u201cWhether the Vatican makes hard changes remains to be seen,\u201d says Pam Spees, a human rights attorney for the Center for Constitutional Rights, which provided a key report to the committee. \u201cNonetheless, today\u2019s hearing is a milestone in calling for an end to the days of impunity.\"\u201cPeople are waiting and watching and there is now a standard by which they will judge the Vatican,\" Ms. Spees adds. \"I think we are seeing a shift and monitoring by international bodies can only be a good thing.\u201dKey papal testThe degree to which the Vatican tackles the issue of sexually abusive clergy is being seen as a key test of the papacy of Pope Francis, who was elected last March after the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI. Pope Francis has announced almost weekly initiatives to reform the Holy See\u2019s governance and clean up its finances, but has said little about the shame of predatory priests.Last month he announced the setting up of a committee to address the issue, but victims\u2019 groups described the initiative as \u201ctoothless,\u201d \u201cmeaningless,\u201d and \u201clike offering a Band Aid to a cancer patient.\u201dOn Thursday, as the UN session was underway in Switzerland, he told worshipers at morning Mass in the Vatican that abuse scandals had \"cost us a lot of money, but [paying damages] is only right.\"Bishops, priests, and lay people were responsible for this \"shame of the Church,\" he said.\"Do we feel shame?

The insider essay on modeling in China opens with the American author, Meredith Hattam, sitting on a train from Chengdu to Beijing with a 16\u00ad-year\u00ad-old Ukrainian friend, Lana. The friend is eating a hard\u00ad-boiled egg. Ms. Hattam makes it clear that eggs are all Lana will eat for the next 10 days because the modeling agency in Beijing that employs the two of them has cut Lana\u2019s weekly allowance due to her weight. Lana had violated the strict measurement standards laid out in her three\u00ad-month modeling contract. Courtesy of Meredith Hattam Meredith Hattam, right, with Maria Kompf at the Dunhuang International Grape Festival in 2011. It is not a glamorous scene, and it sets the stage for the rest of Ms. Hattam\u2019s account of working for several months for an agency in Beijing owned by a former Ukrainian model. The essay appeared recently on Fashionista, a popular blog about the fashion and modeling industries, and gives a look at a world that might appear glitzy to outsiders, but that in Ms. Hattam\u2019s estimation is distressful and demeaning, even if it offers moments of levity and adventure. Ms. Hattam, who now lives in Brooklyn, was around 24 years\u00ad old and had what she described as a \u201ccurvier\u00ad than\u00ad average frame\u201d when she got a job with the agency, which, according to standard practice, had her work in China illegally on a tourist visa. Ms. Hattam wrote that this kind of job constituted \u201cthe dregs of the modeling world, the bottom rung of the high\u00ad fashion ladder.\u201d It means working a series of car shows, fake beauty pageants and pajama catalogs, and on occasion being asked to perform less savory duties. Here is Ms. Hattam on one car show that she worked: For eight hours each day, we\u2019ll lean invitingly on top of a $1.5 million Hummer\u00adlike tank wearing short\u00ad-skirted army uniforms purchased from a party supply store. Our handlers request that we salute every hour, switching into evening gowns during intervals. For that job, the daily pay was 3,000 renmimbi, or about $500. Forty percent went to the agency and 10 percent to the scout, which is not unusual. By the time we leave China, we\u2019ll have earned nothing at all. In Beijing, Ms. Hattam lived in a cramped apartment with 12 other models, most of them under 18 and from countries in the former Soviet Union or Eastern Europe. Of the 13 roommates, there were nine girls and four boys. Most jobs lasted nine hours a day and required travel to Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Hangzhou, cities central to China\u2019s fashion industry. Some jobs did not involve modeling work per se. One 26\u00ad-year\u00ad-old, college\u00ad-educated European colleague was asked to act as a hostess, alone, on an overnight boat trip with older Chinese men. The woman declined and was fired from the agency. Ms. Hattam wrote: Sex will always quietly surround those who make a career selling their image. But in Asia, it\u2019s pervasive: model life, if one so chooses, becomes a hypersexual nightscape of drugs and promiscuity. Older male models frequently sleep with teenagers (whom they often live with), and at clubs prostitution is euphemistically referred to as \u201cworking the after\u00ad-party.\u201d One of Ms. Hattam\u2019s friends, a Canadian model, was asked by the owner of a popular Beijing nightclub to work such a party. For 10,000 renminbi for one night, or more than $1,600, she would \u201centertain\u201d a Chinese businessman. \u201cAfter refusing,\u201d Ms. Hattam wrote, \u201cshe returned home in tears.\u201d Before writing the essay that appeared on Fashionista, Ms. Hattam documented her adventures in China on a blog. The entries have a raw and immediate quality to them. One photograph shows women riding camels along sand dunes in western China. This came from one of the more bizarre episodes in Ms. Hattam\u2019s brief modeling career, when she was sent in September 2011 in a group of 40 models to the ancient desert town of Dunhuang to take part in a fake beauty pageant for Chinese tourists, complete with sashes, bikinis and nightgowns. Ms. Hattam performed as Miss America. A model from Warsaw was appointed Miss India. And so on. I walked. I waved. I smiled \u00ad\u00ad even as my trailing dress fell to my stomach, exposing Miss America\u2019s stars and stripes to 4,000 Chinese strangers, who let out a collective gasp.", "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2014 08:06:12 GMT", "tags": ["Guangzhou (China)", "Dunhuang (China)", "Ukraine", "Beijing (China)", "Blogs and Blogging (Internet)", "Eastern Europe", "China", "Hangzhou (China)", "Shenzhen (China)", "Models (Professional)", "Labor and Jobs"], "title": "Sinosphere Blog: A Dark Look at Modeling in China", "updated": "Tue, 14 Jan 2014 08:06:12 GMT", "author": "By EDWARD WONG", "url": "http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/14/a-dark-look-at-modeling-in-china/?partner=rss&emc=rss", "_id": 33232833, "html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content\"><div class=\"w480\"><img src=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/01/15/world/14sino-models02/14sino-models02-blog480.jpg\" id=\"100000002649106\" alt=\"Models present creations by the Chinese fashion label OudiFu during China Fashion Week in Beijing, March 2012.\u00a0\"/><span class=\"credit\">David Gray/Reuters</span> <span class=\"caption\">Models present creations by the Chinese fashion label OudiFu during China Fashion Week in Beijing, March 2012.\u00a0</span></div>\n<p>The insider <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/2014/01/model-in-china/\">essay</a> on modeling in China opens with the American author, Meredith Hattam, sitting on a train from Chengdu to Beijing with a 16\u00ad-year\u00ad-old Ukrainian friend, Lana.

But only a few months after the end of the five-year trial, \ufffdz has now turned against his former sponsor. Shortly before Christmas, police arrested more than 50 suspects, including politicians with the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), influential businesspeople, and the sons of three cabinet ministers. The investigations were initiated by \ufffdz, who was subsequently taken off the case. The scandal has taken Erdogan into the most serious crisis of his nearly 11 years in office. The corruption scandal within his inner circle is jeopardizing the power of the AKP and threatens to tear it apart -- and that in an election year, in which Erdogan apparently wants to be elected president. The ministers of economics, the interior and urban development resigned on Dec. 25, after the arrest of their sons, who allegedly accepted bribes for providing building permits and public contracts. The next day, Erdogan fired seven other ministers, filling their posts with his confidants. Several senior lawmakers, as well as the head of the state-owned Halkbank, who allegedly orchestrated oil deals with Iran, were also arrested. They are accused of circumventing sanctions against Tehran that prohibit monetary transactions with Iranian banks by paying several billion euros worth of gold in return for oil. When the police raided the bank head's home, they found $4.5 million (\u00803.3 million) in shoeboxes. But this is probably only the beginning of greater turmoil. Even Erdogan himself is becoming increasingly caught up in the corruption scandal. The urban development minister who had resigned, Erdogan Bayraktar, has called upon the prime minister to step down as well. Bayraktar claimed that he had approved the construction projects in question at Erdogan's instruction. Further Arrests in the Pipeline Investigators are apparently planning further arrests, with a list of suspects that includes Erdogan's son Bilal. The 32-year-old is the founder and a board member of the influential T\ufffdrgev Foundation, which acquired a government property in Istanbul's Fatih district at a very favorable price, allegedly paying about \u00803 million in bribes in return. A summons for Bilal Erdogan, signed by Istanbul public prosecutor Muammer Akka, has since been published. But police officers refused to arrest either him or a number of AKP lawmakers, probably on instructions from the political arena. Akka was also removed from the case. In a statement last Thursday, he said: \"My investigations were blocked. The judiciary was apparently put under pressure.\" Meanwhile, Erdogan is trying to paint the scandal as a conspiracy against his government. He blames it on a \"gang\" that aims to harm Turkey. In a televised address on Jan. 1, Erdogan called on his fellow Turks to help fight what he called a plot by foreign-backed elements. \"I invite every one of our 76 million people to stand up for themselves, to defend democracy and to be as one against these ugly attacks on our country,\" he said. But even Erdogan's supporters are irritated by his tirades. And the louder he gets, the clearer it becomes that the once popular premier is fighting for his political future. Erdogan, a former mayor of Istanbul, came into office on the promise of putting an end to the cronyism of his predecessors. It helped get him elected in 2002 and has seen his government returned to office two times since then. But the AKP is not governing as cleanly as Erdogan claimed. It has long been plagued by allegations of corruption. In the embassy cables published by WikiLeaks in 2010, US diplomats reported \"corruption at all levels\" in Turkey. 'No One Wanted to Listen' \"We have addressed the subject of corruption within the government for years, but no one wanted to listen,\" says Aye Danioglu, a member of parliament for the opposition party, the CHP. \"It finally took a dispute within the Islamic camp to uncover the dirt of the past few years.\" The accusations have never been this detailed, nor have they been this dangerous for the prime minister. For the first time, it is not only members of the opposition who are attacking Erdogan, but also some of his previous supporters, especially those aligned with the Turkish preacher Fethullah G\ufffdlen. G\ufffdlen lives in exile in the United States. His supporters have established schools, media companies, hospitals and companies worldwide. The G\ufffdlen community seeks to portray itself as a civil society movement that primarily promotes education. But former members describe the community as hierarchical, political and Islamist. G\ufffdlen and Erdogan long enjoyed a successful cooperative relationship. G\ufffdlen secured votes for the premier, while Erdogan protected the community's business dealings. With Erdogan's patronage, G\ufffdlen supporters secured key positions with the police and in the judiciary. In the Ergenekon trial, G\ufffdlen and Erdogan collaborated to bring down their chief adversaries: the military and the secular opposition. A 'Declaration of War' Zekeriya \ufffdz, considered a G\ufffdlen supporter, was the chief prosecutor in the trial, the largest in recent Turkish history. The accused allegedly planned terrorist attacks to overthrow the government. Observers criticized the trial, which ended in August 2013 after five years, calling it a farce. Details from the trial were regularly leaked to media organizations owned by the G\ufffdlen movement, and regime critics were publicly denounced. In recent months, however, the alliance has begun to crumble. G\ufffdlen's supporters had apparently become too powerful for Erdogan. At the same time, he obviously came to perceive them as disloyal, dismissing a number of officials aligned with the community. G\ufffdlen supporters in the judiciary subsequently attempted to prosecute the intelligence chief, an important confidant of the prime minister, but were unsuccessful. In November, Erdogan announced that G\ufffdlen tutoring centers were to be shut down. The educational facilities prepare pupils for university entrance examinations and are an important source of income for the movement. The newspaper H\ufffdrriyet called the move a \"declaration of war.\" For this reason, the investigations can arguably also be seen as the G\ufffdlen movement's attempt to exact revenge on the prime minister. Erdogan calls it a \"very dirty operation\" and accuses G\ufffdlen supporters of trying to establish a \"state within the state.\" G\ufffdlen replied with a video address, in which he said: \"May God bring fire onto the houses of those who do not see the thief, but instead persecute those who are hunting the thief.\" This is the second time that Erdogan has come under fire recently. In the summer, more than three million people protested for months against the redevelopment of Gezi Park in Istanbul. But the movement soon expanded into a broader protest against Erdogan's increasingly despotic style of government. After almost 11 years in office, Erdogan seems increasingly autocratic and disconnected from reality. He has now replaced many capable advisers with loyal yes-men. Success makes some politicians more relaxed, but in recent years Erdogan has, in many respects, developed into precisely the type of autocratic ruler he once vowed to abolish. Critics have been locked away under Erdogan's rule. Turkey has more journalists and supposed terror suspects in prison than anywhere else. AKP at Risk Erdogan reacted obstinately to the protests in the summer, berating his critics as \"bums\" and having his security forces fire tear gas at them. He has also proved to be relentless in the current crisis. Some 500 police officers have been transferred, and Erdogan also attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, to gain control over investigations by decree. But in contrast to the Gezi protests, this time Erdogan will not be able to bring the crisis under control by taking a tough approach. It is already becoming clear that the scandal could break apart his party. Erdogan's goal of having himself elected president in the summer is becoming more and more tenuous. He would like to endow the position with significantly more power, but he is now unlikely to secure the necessary two-thirds majority in parliament. Under the rules of Erdogan's AK party, he is prohibited from seeking an additional term as prime minister. To run for a fourth term he would have to change the party's charter, but there is already growing resistance within the AKP to such a move. President Abdullah G\ufffdl, in particular, now opposes his longtime ally. Finally, the economy, the most important factor in persuading many citizens to vote for Erdogan, is growing weaker. The Turkish lira recently fell to a record low. Foreign investment, which brought in capital that fueled the boom of recent years, has been in decline for some time. If investors continue to withdraw money from Turkey, the result could be an economic slump, which could cost Erdogan votes. The opposition is sending a candidate with serious prospects of winning the race for mayor of Istanbul in next March's local elections. This makes AKP officials increasingly nervous, because they know that whoever loses Istanbul will lose Turkey.", "published": "Thu, 02 Jan 2014 10:51:00 +0100", "tags": null, "title": "Erdogan's Endgame: Corruption Scandal Threatens Turkish Leader", "updated": "Thu, 02 Jan 2014 10:51:00 +0100", "author": null, "url": "http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/erdogan-threatened-by-expanding-turkey-corruption-scandal-a-941138.html#ref=rss", "_id": 33955228, "html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"article-section clearfix\">&#13;\n\t\n<p>Istanbul public prosecutor Zekeriya \ufffdz has investigated Turkey's elite, those who were seen as untouchable: politicians, journalists, attorneys and generals. \ufffdz has been the most important criminal prosecutor under Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, helping him take legal measures against the network known as the \"Ergenekon,\" whose members were allegedly planning a coup against the government.

LOS ANGELES \u2014 The embattled sheriff of Los Angeles, Lee Baca, announced Tuesday that he will retire at the end of the month and not seek re-election. His announcement ends weeks of speculation about his future amid federal investigations and accusations of widespread misconduct in his department. \u201cI will go out on my own terms,\u201d Mr. Baca said during an emotional news conference Tuesday morning, flanked by dozens of top deputies and civilian officials. \u201cI know I turn 72 in May. I don\u2019t see myself as the future, I see myself as part of the past. I see it as important to allow the future to run.\u201d Mr. Baca was expected to face a fierce battle for re-election for a fifth term this year. Last month, 18 officers and deputies were indicted on federal charges of abusing inmates and visitors in the county jails. When it became clear that the F.B.I. was investigating the problems in the county jail system, the largest in the country, several high-ranking officials tried to cover up the actions, federal authorities say. Mr. Baca has also come under fire recently for hiring practices that favored those with special connections to him. Mr. Baca would not say clearly whether he was facing federal prosecution. When pressed, he told reporters: \u201cYou don\u2019t become a deputy sheriff if you\u2019re afraid.

Jim Wilson/The New York Times The cast of candidates seeking to challenge Mr. Brown is sparse.Neel Kashkari, a former assistant treasury secretary who has never run for public office before, announced Tuesday that he was seeking the Republican nomination. The other main Republican candidate is Tim Donnelly, a member of the Assembly with ties to the Tea Party. A former lieutenant governor, Abel Maldonado, last week ended his brief campaign.Governor Brown was playful and jaunty in his speech before the members of the Assembly and Senate.

The friend is eating a hard\u00ad-boiled egg. Ms. Hattam makes it clear that eggs are all Lana will eat for the next 10 days because the modeling agency in Beijing that employs the two of them has cut Lana\u2019s weekly allowance due to her weight. Lana had violated the strict measurement standards laid out in her three\u00ad-month modeling contract. It is not a glamorous scene, and it sets the stage for the rest of Ms. Hattam\u2019s account of working for several months for an agency in Beijing owned by a former Ukrainian model. The essay appeared recently on Fashionista, a popular blog about the fashion and modeling industries, and gives a look at a world that might appear glitzy to outsiders, but that in Ms. Hattam\u2019s estimation is distressful and demeaning, even if it offers moments of levity and adventure. Ms. Hattam, who now lives in Brooklyn, was around 24 years\u00ad old and had what she described as a \u201ccurvier\u00ad than\u00ad average frame\u201d when she got a job with the agency, which, according to standard practice, had her work in China illegally on a tourist visa. Ms. Hattam wrote that this kind of job constituted \u201cthe dregs of the modeling world, the bottom rung of the high\u00ad fashion ladder.\u201d It means working a series of car shows, fake beauty pageants and pajama catalogs, and on occasion being asked to perform less savory duties. Here is Ms. Hattam on one car show that she worked: For eight hours each day, we\u2019ll lean invitingly on top of a $1.5 million Hummer\u00adlike tank wearing short\u00ad-skirted army uniforms purchased from a party supply store. Our handlers request that we salute every hour, switching into evening gowns during intervals. For that job, the daily pay was 3,000 renmimbi, or about $500. Forty percent went to the agency and 10 percent to the scout, which is not unusual. By the time we leave China, we\u2019ll have earned nothing at all. In Beijing, Ms. Hattam lived in a cramped apartment with 12 other models, most of them under 18 and from countries in the former Soviet Union or Eastern Europe. Of the 13 roommates, there were nine girls and four boys. Most jobs lasted nine hours a day and required travel to Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Hangzhou, cities central to China\u2019s fashion industry. Some jobs did not involve modeling work per se. One 26\u00ad-year\u00ad-old, college\u00ad-educated European colleague was asked to act as a hostess, alone, on an overnight boat trip with older Chinese men. The woman declined and was fired from the agency. Ms. Hattam wrote: Sex will always quietly surround those who make a career selling their image. But in Asia, it\u2019s pervasive: model life, if one so chooses, becomes a hypersexual nightscape of drugs and promiscuity. Older male models frequently sleep with teenagers (whom they often live with), and at clubs prostitution is euphemistically referred to as \u201cworking the after\u00ad-party.\u201d One of Ms. Hattam\u2019s friends, a Canadian model, was asked by the owner of a popular Beijing nightclub to work such a party. For 10,000 renminbi for one night, or more than $1,600, she would \u201centertain\u201d a Chinese businessman. \u201cAfter refusing,\u201d Ms. Hattam wrote, \u201cshe returned home in tears.\u201d Before writing the essay that appeared on Fashionista, Ms. Hattam documented her adventures in China on a blog. The entries have a raw and immediate quality to them. One photograph shows women riding camels along sand dunes in western China. This came from one of the more bizarre episodes in Ms. Hattam\u2019s brief modeling career, when she was sent in September 2011 in a group of 40 models to the ancient desert town of Dunhuang to take part in a fake beauty pageant for Chinese tourists, complete with sashes, bikinis and nightgowns. Ms. Hattam performed as Miss America. A model from Warsaw was appointed Miss India. And so on. I walked. I waved. I smiled \u00ad\u00ad even as my trailing dress fell to my stomach, exposing Miss America\u2019s stars and stripes to 4,000 Chinese strangers, who let out a collective gasp.", "published": "Tue, 14 Jan 2014 07:28:09 GMT", "tags": ["Guangzhou (China)", "Dunhuang (China)", "Ukraine", "Beijing (China)", "Blogs and Blogging (Internet)", "Eastern Europe", "China", "Hangzhou (China)", "Shenzhen (China)", "Models (Professional)", "Labor and Jobs"], "title": "Sinosphere Blog: A Dark Look at Modeling in China", "updated": "Tue, 14 Jan 2014 07:28:09 GMT", "author": "By EDWARD WONG", "url": "http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/14/a-dark-look-at-modeling-in-china/?partner=rss&emc=rss", "_id": 36640714, "html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content\"><p>The insider <a href=\"http://fashionista.com/2014/01/model-in-china/\">essay</a> on modeling in China opens with the American author, Meredith Hattam, sitting on a train from Chengdu to Beijing with a 16\u00ad-year\u00ad-old Ukrainian friend, Lana.

For 10,000 renminbi for one night, or more than $1,600, she would \u201centertain\u201d a Chinese businessman. \u201cAfter refusing,\u201d Ms. Hattam wrote, \u201cshe returned home in tears.\u201d</p>\n<p>Before writing the essay that appeared on Fashionista, Ms. Hattam documented her adventures in China on a <a href=\"http://meredithhattam.com/blog/\">blog</a>. The entries have a raw and immediate quality to them. One photograph shows women riding camels along sand dunes in western China. This came from one of the more bizarre episodes in Ms. Hattam\u2019s brief modeling career, when she was sent in September 2011 in a group of 40 models to the ancient desert town of Dunhuang to take part in a fake beauty pageant for Chinese tourists, complete with sashes, bikinis and nightgowns.</p>\n<p>Ms. Hattam performed as Miss America.

The women were fully decked out in colorful evening gowns, the men in tuxedos. Some sported expensive purses, ornate Venetian-style masquerade masks, or ribbons with the English words \"Team Elite.\" One took to Sina Weibo, a social media platform, to urge her followers to join her: \"if you are also a little bit vain, if you feel like you should be the star in your own life.\" For those ambitious enough, she continued, \"next year's spotlight could be on you.\" These young Chinese are self-styled Nu Stars, a moniker for salespeople for Nu Skin, a Utah-based health product maker that reportedly made more than 31 percent of its total revenue of $2.16 billion in China, all just in the first nine months of 2013 (fourth-quarter data is forthcoming). The company acknowledged Jan. 16 that it is now under investigation for marketing practices that, according to Chinese state-owned media, involve brainwashing and defrauding these fervent young members of China's wannabe glamour set. Like Amway and Mary Kay, Nu Skin relies on salespeople peddling products directly to family and friends, while developing new recruits to do the same. This technique has a checkered history in many parts of the world including the United States, but it is particularly fraught in China. In 1998, the Chinese government banned all enterprises employing the practice after a flood of pyramid schemes claimed thousands of victims, but eased the restrictions somewhat in 2005 to allow \"direct selling,\" whereby salespeople earn a commission based on the quantity of products sold, rather than the number of \"downlines,\" an industry term for new enlists. U.S. companies with well-developed direct selling cultures, like Amway, Herbalife, and Mary Kay, still boast a significant collective presence in China, albeit with somewhat modified business models that involve opening brick-and-mortar stores and registering salespeople as distributors. But Nu Skin was reportedly more aggressive in its practices, employing salespeople directly and compensating them for downlines. This deviated dangerously from a relatively well-tested gray area, and toward a clear violation of Chinese regulations. On Jan. 21, Nu Skin announced that it would halt recruitment of new distributors in China. Rules aimed at direct selling in China are not simply intended to protect consumers from falling prey to pyramid schemes. The ruling Communist Party has historically been extra-vigilant about direct selling because it often involves some forms of mass gathering and indoctrination, which the Party deems to be key factors in developing dissent. Chinese authorities reportedly busted more than 7,600 pyramid schemes involving more than 60,000 people over a three-month period in 2013 in a campaign against direct selling. The hold of these rings on their adherents can be so strong that government interference sometimes lead to unrest: In May 2013, hundreds of people involved in a direct-sales scam confronted police in the central city of Hefei, injuring 32 officers. Those involved with Nu Skin, however, don\u2019t seem interested in political organizing, just the mirage of success that lies in slickly-packaged beauty products with foreign names like \"ageLOC\"and \"Scion.\" Over 10,000 user accounts on Sina Weibo have \"Nu Skin,\" \"Nu Star\" or \"ruxin,\" the Chinese name for Nu Skin, in their handles. The sample is certainly skewed because Weibo, with over 280 million total users, has a youthful demographic. Nonetheless, it is revealing that an overwhelming majority of the Nu Star-labeled accounts are young women in their twenties and thirties. A fair number proudly show off the label \"post-90,\" a common way of referring to young people born after 1990. Many call Nu Skin a \"platform for young entrepreneurs,\" where they can \"work hard, play hard.\" Judging from their social media personalities, Nu Stars are a group of Chinese youth aching for recognition, glamour, and freedom -- all in relatively short supply elsewhere in their lives. Even after winning a brutal competition for thankless, low-paying jobs, many young Chinese still struggle to pay rent, support their families, and find extra money to afford the luxury goods that their country's middle class conspicuously consumes. An August 2013 article in Chinese state-owned media cited a police report that concluded that an increasing number of college graduates join pyramid schemes because \"they have become frustrated by tough competition in the job market.\" Indeed, the self-motivational quotes about hard work and overcoming obstacles that interlard the large number of online posts from Nu Skin salespeople do not carry the faintest whiff of political dissent. Instead, these young people appear to be desperately searching for a way to climb a social ladder that has become increasingly slippery. The promise of a less-treacherous path to riches -- even one that involves hard work, not just play -- has drawn tens of thousands of Chinese youth looking for somewhere to channel their aspirations. Many young Chinese, overwhelmed by the seemingly unattainable material demands that beset their early adult lives, say they have given up trying to meet them. For a brief time, Nu Skin appeared to offer a different path for those determined to fight for what they perceived to be the good life. Self-declared Nu Stars partied, preened, and posed before Nu Skin-branded backdrops as if they were Hollywood royalty on the red carpet. Now it may be time for them to return to a harsher reality.

It looks as if it's all right nextdoor. Oympia Park is located less than two kilometers away from Skiba's home. What worries him these days, though, is the fact that this distance isn't remaining constant. The space between his home and the stadium is decreasing, slowly but ever so surely. The hillside upon which his home is built is sliding down into the valley at a pace of 1.5 meters (nearly five feet) per year, Skiba claims. Residents of Baku Street had long been puzzled by the erosion that was causing their homes to slide or lean. A thick forest begins just behind the home of Skiba's neighbors. Sometimes they collect firewood there. It's in this forest that they first discovered the reason for the landslide. Excavators there dug out a pit where trucks had been dumping rubble -- waste from the Olympic construction sites. \"The garbage dump has altered the groundwater flow on the hill,\" says Vladimir Kimayev, a member of the group Environmental Watch. \"That's why the homes are sliding.\" The worst hit home is a multi-family structure located across the street from the Skibas. Over the course of a few months, the five-story building slid down the hill along Baku Street. Before it was torn down, it destroyed the wooden hut of a neighbor. Skiba says a five-story building should never have been allowed to be built in Baku Street. The construction company responsible for it, like so many in Sochi, had not obtained any official permits. A Promise of 'Green Games' Skiba says he invested around \u008062,000 ($84,400) in his house, money that came from savings, but also from \"loans that still torment me today.\" The authorities approved the plans in 2010. He says they said a two-story building for two families would be no problem. Today, when Skiba's grandchildren play in the living room, the ball always roles into the same corner. The earth movements have literally tilted the house, which now leans at four degrees -- the same slope gradient as the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Skiba has jacked up the refrigerator on one side with boards so that the compote his wife cooked won't spill out of the glasses. When Sochi was awarded the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in 2007, the Kremlin pledged \"zero waste,\" meaning no environmental pollution. When the news emerged in October that Russia's state railway had been dumping construction waste from a large project to create a highway and railroad link between the Sochi airport and the Olympic venues at what authorities have described as an illegal landfill in the Caucasus, the International Olympic Committee reacted with outrage. At the same time, it must have been clear that with the magnitude of investments required to prepare for an event as big as the Olympics, this promise of a \"green games\" would be very difficult to keep. The Winter Olympics in Sochi are a highly complex undertaking. The Kremlin has constructed six stadiums along the Black Sea coast. In addition, ski trails have been erected, as well as ski jumps and dozens of five-star hotels on the hills of the Caucasus. The sporting facilities in the mountains and along the shoreline have been connected with a recently built mountain road. A new train line operates alongside it. 'They're Trying to Silence Me' Environmentalists have little power against a prestigious project of this size, and most environmental organizations have already left Sochi. Environmental Watch in the North Caucasus, a regional umbrella group of activists that also includes Vladimir Kimayev, is the exception. Environmental Watch protested against the pollution of rivers through Olympic construction and also against the destruction of forests, but it had very little success. The group also fought against any construction along the shoreline and beaches. Environmental Watch gained the attention of the international media a few years ago when activists stormed the property of several luxurious mansions that had been erected in protected nature conservation areas. One of the homes had been built by the governor of the area. Another residence -- a veritable palace with a casino and helicopter landing pad -- was reportedly intended forVladimir Putin himself. One environmental activist accused of damaging the fence of the governor's residence was even given a three-year suspended jail sentence. And one year ago, Environmental Watch head Suren Gazaryan became the subject of an investigation. He was accused of attempted murder. It was alleged that Gazaryan had threatened to kill a guard on the grounds of the mansion intended for Putin and that he had wielded a stone. The environmental activist has since applied for political asylum in Estonia. However, activist Kimayev has chosen to remain in Sochi. In order to avoid the long traffic jams in the coastal city, he often travels on his moped. But that, too, proved dangerous for the activist this fall when his brakes failed. Kimayev believes his moped was sabotaged. \"They're trying to silence me,\" he says. Is President Putin the Last Hope? Local authorities have offered Tigran Skiba and others of Baku Street emergency accommodations, but they only include one room for each family. For the time being, Skiba has decided to stay in his leaning house. He often stays awake at night listening to the creaking sounds the house makes, just in case he needs to wake up his wife, children and grandchildren if he fears it is going to collapse. The family believes its last hope lies with President Putin. Skiba's neighbor Svetlana Afanasyeva, 60, stands in her front yard, a resolute woman wearing a bathrobe. She used to live down along the coast until construction began on the sporting facilities, in an area known as the Imereti Depression. Svetlana and her husband were paid a generous amount of compensation for their move -- around \u0080250,000. With the money, they purchased an apartment for their daughter, the property on Baku Street and a wooden house that is now falling apart. Afanasyeva recently wrote a personal letter to Putin. \"Your honorable Vladimir Vladimirovitch, I am writing to you from Sochi, which was an enchanting place until the pigs came,\" she write. The letter ends with a plea: \"Perhaps the next time you are in the gorgeous new city down below, you might pay attention for a moment to what is happening to us up here on the hill.\" \ufffd SPIEGEL ONLINE 2014 All Rights Reserved Reproduction only allowed with the permission of SPIEGELnet GmbH", "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2014 11:54:00 +0100", "tags": null, "title": "Olympic Construction Sins: The Leaning Houses of Sochi", "updated": "Fri, 10 Jan 2014 11:54:00 +0100", "author": null, "url": "http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/environmental-damage-and-botched-construction-mar-sochi-a-942803.html#ref=rss", "_id": 52435578, "html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"article-section clearfix\">&#13;\n\t\n<p>When Tigran Skiba, 52, leaves home in his delivery truck each morning to supply fresh bread throughout Sochi, he gets a view of the new sporting facilities: Fisht Olympic Stadium in the valley and the grand ice-skating palace, which shimmers in the moonlight like a pearl.

Afghan farmers work at a poppy field in Jalalabad province, on May 5, 2012. (Reuters/Parwiz)Testifying Wednesday before the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, John Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, offered a grim assessment of the war-torn country\u2014and revealed startling details about America\u2019s hapless reconstruction efforts there. Few have a job as challenging as Sopko\u2019s. As the inspector general, he must study our actions and spending, and uncover and investigate examples of fraud, waste, abuse, and corruption. Since the U.S. has spent the last 12 years blasting dollars into Afghanistan, \u201cfollowing the money\u201d is a task on the order of investigating grains of sand in the desert. Still, Sopko and his team have proven to be uncompromising, inexhaustible, and enormously effective. His office is independent; he is not beholden to the usual feudal lords in Washington. As Congress has decided to sit this war out, Sopko has proven to be the conflict\u2019s only real oversight mechanism. Since taking charge in 2012, he\u2019s uncovered everything from $230 million in missing spare parts to spending on diesel running $500 per gallon (when the going rate was around $5 per gallon). Thanks to Sopko, American taxpayers learned that they bought $200,000 thermostats for air conditioners in a small medical clinic that was never completed\u2014and according to the Afghan government, was probably never going to be used. And that\u2019s just in the areas to which he has access. Because of security concerns, by next year his office will be restricted to a mere 21 percent of the country. And according to Sopko\u2019s congressional testimony, things are bad. Really bad. Since the fall of the Taliban government at the start of the war, the United States has invested $10 billion to fight the Afghan drug trade, through efforts such as ending poppy cultivation, halting the manufacture of narcotics, establishing drug treatment programs, and building a robust counternarcotics police force and criminal justice system. This might be money well spent, as 90 percent of the world\u2019s opium originates in Afghanistan. No effort to build a stable nation there can succeed amid the hurricane forces of financial and institutional corruption that come with a thriving drug trade. \u201cMore land in Afghanistan is under poppy cultivation today than it was when the United States overthrew the Taliban in 2002.\u201dBut 12 years and $10 billion later, according to Sopko\u2019s testimony, \u201cAfghan farmers are growing more opium poppies today than at any time in their modern history,\u201d and despite the \u201cmammoth investment\u201d of American dollars and blood, \u201cmore land in Afghanistan is under poppy cultivation today than it was when the United States overthrew the Taliban in 2002.\u201d Still, the optimist might argue, good policies under hard conditions take time to bear fruit. So five years after President Obama assumed decisive control over our strategy in Afghanistan and tripled the number of U.S. service members in that war, are his efforts finally set to pay dividends? Said Sopko: \u201cIn the opinion of almost everyone I spoke with, the situation in Afghanistan is dire with little prospect for improvement in 2014 or beyond.\u201d As a result, \u201cAll of the fragile gains we have made over the last twelve years on women\u2019s issues, health, education, rule of law, and governance are now, more than ever, in jeopardy of being wiped out by the narcotics trade which not only supports the insurgency, but also feeds organized crime and corruption.\u201d One-third of the Taliban\u2019s funding is thought to come from opium. And though U.S. officials have remained fixed in the denial stage of the K\u00fcbler-Ross model, claiming that we can work with elements of the Taliban, the news remains bleak all the same. According to Sopko, \u201cIt is widely thought that every drug organization supports or works with insurgents in Afghanistan.\u201d The exhausted American might wonder: Why does it matter? With the litany of problems in Afghanistan, why should we care about fields of pink flowers and the drugs they yield? This is a fair question, but assumes that the drug trade is an island unto itself. Not so, according to the inspector general. \u201cOpium cultivation and insecurity go hand in hand,\u201d the report noted. \u201cAbout 89% of total poppy cultivation this year occurred in Afghanistan\u2019s southern and western regions, where insurgents and criminal networks are strongest.\u201d And the problem is spreading. Nangarhar, the eastern province in Afghanistan whose capital is Jalalabad, was declared \u201cpoppy free\u201d in 2008 and had been hailed as a model province. In the span of one year, however\u2014from 2012 to 2013\u2014poppy cultivation has increased 500 percent, now covering 15,719 hectares of the province. *** It\u2019s hard to make the argument that the United States has ever waged a drug war effectively, and our work in Afghanistan is no exception to that. In 2002, we had a sweep-and-destroy policy for poppy fields in Afghanistan that yielded little success. As the late Richard Holbrooke, America\u2019s special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, said in 2009, \u201c[Those policies] did not result in any damage to the Taliban, but they put farmers out of work and they alienated people and drove people into the arms of the Taliban.\u201d A more sensible policy was thus implemented, in which the U.S. would encourage and assist farmers in planting alternative crops such as saffron and grapes. Executed in parallel were training programs to establish an Afghan equivalent of the Drug Enforcement Administration; drug interdiction programs to get drugs off the black market; and the use of forensic accounting to squeeze Taliban revenues at their sources. At the local level, basic security measures were implemented to provide law-and-order in villages and towns, and rehab clinics were established to help addicts. In other words, the U.S. led a full-spectrum effort to provide a better life for the average Afghan, which would in turn make poppy cultivation less appealing. \u201cNonetheless,\u201d said Sopko, \u201con my last trip to Afghanistan no one at the Embassy could convincingly explain to me how the U.S. government counternarcotics efforts are making a meaningful impact on the narcotics trade or how they will have a significant impact after the 2014 transition.\u201d Surprised? So was Sopko. \u201cI was astonished to find that the counternarcotics effort does not seem to be a top priority during this critical transition period and beyond,\u201d he wrote. Given the nature of narcotics as a sustaining force for the insurgency, both in terms of funding and as leverage over the Afghan populace, one would think any plan for withdrawal would make counternarcotics central to a lasting (or, at least, plausible) strategy for peace. Even granting a pass to the execution and effectiveness of our counternarcotics program, as the inspector general noted, \u201cthe United States does not have a comprehensive anti-corruption strategy even though Afghanistan is universally recognized as one of the most corrupt countries in the world. The narcotics trade is fueling that corruption.\u201d In September, SIGAR, as Sopko\u2019s office is known, released an extensive and wholly depressing report noting that the United States has no clear strategy on fighting corruption and no metric for success. Plans had previously been drafted to do just such things, but were never finalized and eventually found a home in some drawer at the State Department; the proposals have since expired. In place of a coherent strategy to fight corruption, officials adopted guidelines from two documents: the Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework and the U.S. Civil-Military Strategic Framework for Afghanistan. The inspector general studied the documents, and noticed something conspicuously absent: \u201cspecific goals and objectives with measurable outcomes for anti-corruption activities against which the U.S. government can measure its progress.\u201d The DEA is soon to become yet another U.S. agency ensconced at our fortress in Kabul, sealed behind Roman testudo-style blast walls.Arguably, this is part of the U.S. government\u2019s broader plan to declare victory and go home. After all, if your plan lacks stated objectives, and elides both a standard of success and a way of measuring progress, who can really say we didn\u2019t win the war? Who\u2019s to say our anti-corruption efforts haven\u2019t been a resounding success? Reality, it seems, is whatever we decree it to be. And still it\u2019s worse than that. Earlier this month, SIGAR released a report on Afghanistan\u2019s banking sector. \u201cForensic audits of major commercial banks in Afghanistan have identified systemic weaknesses in many areas of banking governance and operations, including personnel capacity, internal controls, accounting, credit analysis, and compliance with regulations,\u201d the study noted. \u201c[The central bank of Afghanistan\u2019s] ongoing limitations and inability to conduct robust oversight allows such weaknesses in Afghan banks to remain unchecked, heightening the risk of another banking crisis.\u201d In other words, except for everything a bank is supposed to do, and every safeguard a bank is supposed to have, the banks in Afghanistan are great. This is particularly problematic in the context of the illicit drug trade, as corrupt banks make following money trails difficult, and lend themselves to money-laundering operations\u2014a known and ongoing problem in the country. *** Security in Afghanistan is deteriorating and law enforcement is a mess. Even the prisons have become a problem. In 2009, the Counternarcotics Justice Center in Afghanistan opened prisons specifically built for drug offenders. Within three months, the jails were filled with \u201clow-profile detainees,\u201d leaving no room for\u2014you guessed it!\u2014drug offenders. At any rate, the Counternarcotics Justice Center lacks procedures to handle a high caseload, which isn\u2019t a big deal\u2014unless your country produces 90 percent of the world\u2019s opium. As the U.S. military withdraws from Afghanistan, so too is the Drug Enforcement Agency. Forget advising forces in Helmand and Kandahar provinces\u2014the twin poppy capitals of the world. As the inspector general reports, \u201cwithout military support for security, intelligence, medical evacuation, and tactical air control for high-risk operations, DEA will have little ability to extend its operations beyond Kabul.\u201d The upshot is the DEA is soon to become yet another U.S. agency ensconced at our fortress in Kabul, sealed behind Roman testudo-style blast walls and fences draped with anti-sniper netting. Sopko concluded his testimony with an ominous assessment of things to come. \u201cThe people I spoke with in Afghanistan in my last few trips talked about two possible outcomes following the 2014 transition in Afghanistan: a successful modern state, or an insurgent state,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHowever, there is a third possibility: a narco-criminal state. Absent effective counternarcotics programs and Afghan political will to seriously tackle this grave problem, that third outcome may become a reality.\u201d", "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 00:39:18 GMT", "tags": ["International"], "title": "The Looming Narco-State in Afghanistan", "updated": "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 00:39:18 GMT", "author": "D.B.

As Congress has decided to sit this war out, Sopko has proven to be the conflict\u2019s only real oversight mechanism.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"ad adIn-article\" id=\"adIn-article3\">\n<noscript><div><a href=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=%2F4624%2FTheAtlanticOnline%2Fchannel_international&amp;t=src%3Dblog%26by%3Dd-b-grady%26title%3Dthe-looming-narco-state-in-afghanistan%26pos%3Din-article&amp;sz=300x185&amp;c=53361654&amp;tile=3\" title=\"\"><img src=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=%2F4624%2FTheAtlanticOnline%2Fchannel_international&amp;t=src%3Dblog%26by%3Dd-b-grady%26title%3Dthe-looming-narco-state-in-afghanistan%26pos%3Din-article&amp;sz=300x185&amp;c=53361654&amp;tile=3\" alt=\"\"/></a></div></noscript>\n</div><p>Since taking charge in 2012, he\u2019s <a href=\"http://theweek.com/article/index/253258/how-one-inspector-general-is-fighting-fraud-and-waste-in-afghanistan\">uncovered everything</a> from $230 million in missing spare parts to spending on diesel running $500 per gallon (when the going rate was around $5 per gallon). Thanks to Sopko, American taxpayers learned that they bought $200,000 thermostats for air conditioners in a small medical clinic that was never completed\u2014and according to the Afghan government, was probably never going to be used. And that\u2019s just in the areas to which he has access. Because of security concerns, by next year his office will be restricted to a mere 21 percent of the country.</p>\n\n<p>And according to Sopko\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.sigar.mil/pdf/audits/SIGAR-14-21-TY.pdf\">congressional testimony</a>, things are bad. Really bad.</p>\n\n<p>Since the fall of the Taliban government at the start of the war, the United States has invested $10 billion to fight the Afghan drug trade, through efforts such as ending poppy cultivation, halting the manufacture of narcotics, establishing drug treatment programs, and building a robust counternarcotics police force and criminal justice system. This might be money well spent, as 90 percent of the world\u2019s opium originates in Afghanistan. No effort to build a stable nation there can succeed amid the hurricane forces of financial and institutional corruption that come with a thriving drug trade.</p>\n\n<aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\">\u201cMore land in Afghanistan is under poppy cultivation today than it was when the United States overthrew the Taliban in 2002.\u201d</aside><p>But 12 years and $10 billion later, according to Sopko\u2019s testimony, \u201cAfghan farmers are growing more opium poppies today than at any time in their modern history,\u201d and despite the \u201cmammoth investment\u201d of American dollars and blood, \u201cmore land in Afghanistan is under poppy cultivation today than it was when the United States overthrew the Taliban in 2002.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Still, the optimist might argue, good policies under hard conditions take time to bear fruit. So five years after President Obama assumed decisive control over our strategy in Afghanistan and <a href=\"http://www.cato.org/blog/incredible-expanding-afghan-war\">tripled</a> the number of U.S. service members in that war, are his efforts finally set to pay dividends? Said Sopko: \u201cIn the opinion of almost everyone I spoke with, the situation in Afghanistan is dire with little prospect for improvement in 2014 or beyond.\u201d As a result, \u201cAll of the fragile gains we have made over the last twelve years on women\u2019s issues, health, education, rule of law, and governance are now, more than ever, in jeopardy of being wiped out by the narcotics trade which not only supports the insurgency, but also feeds organized crime and corruption.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>One-third of the Taliban\u2019s funding is thought to come from opium. And though U.S. officials have remained fixed in the denial stage of the K\u00fcbler-Ross model, claiming that we can work with elements of the Taliban, the news remains bleak all the same. According to Sopko, \u201cIt is widely thought that every drug organization supports or works with insurgents in Afghanistan.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The exhausted American might wonder: <em>Why does it matter?</em> <em>With the litany of problems in Afghanistan, why should we care about fields of pink flowers and the drugs they yield?</em> This is a fair question, but assumes that the drug trade is an island unto itself. Not so, according to the inspector general. \u201cOpium cultivation and insecurity go hand in hand,\u201d the report noted. \u201cAbout 89% of total poppy cultivation this year occurred in Afghanistan\u2019s southern and western regions, where insurgents and criminal networks are strongest.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>And the problem is spreading. Nangarhar, the eastern province in Afghanistan whose capital is Jalalabad, was declared \u201cpoppy free\u201d in 2008 and had been hailed as a model province. In the span of one year, however\u2014from 2012 to 2013\u2014poppy cultivation has increased <a href=\"http://www.unodc.org/documents/crop-monitoring/Afghanistan/Afghan_report_Summary_Findings_2013.pdf\">500 percent</a>, now covering 15,719 hectares of the province.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s hard to make the argument that the United States has ever waged a drug war effectively, and our work in Afghanistan is no exception to that. In 2002, we had a sweep-and-destroy policy for poppy fields in Afghanistan that yielded little success. As the late Richard Holbrooke, America\u2019s special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/28/world/asia/28holbrooke.html?_r=0\">said</a> in 2009, \u201c[Those policies] did not result in any damage to the Taliban, but they put farmers out of work and they alienated people and drove people into the arms of the Taliban.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>A more sensible policy was thus implemented, in which the U.S. would encourage and assist farmers in planting alternative crops such as saffron and grapes. Executed in parallel were training programs to establish an Afghan equivalent of the Drug Enforcement Administration; drug interdiction programs to get drugs off the black market; and the use of forensic accounting to squeeze Taliban revenues at their sources. At the local level, basic security measures were implemented to provide law-and-order in villages and towns, and rehab clinics were established to help addicts. In other words, the U.S. led a full-spectrum effort to provide a better life for the average Afghan, which would in turn make poppy cultivation less appealing. \u201cNonetheless,\u201d said Sopko, \u201con my last trip to Afghanistan no one at the Embassy could convincingly explain to me how the U.S. government counternarcotics efforts are making a meaningful impact on the narcotics trade or how they will have a significant impact after the 2014 transition.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Surprised? So was Sopko. \u201cI was astonished to find that the counternarcotics effort does not seem to be a top priority during this critical transition period and beyond,\u201d he wrote. Given the nature of narcotics as a sustaining force for the insurgency, both in terms of funding and as leverage over the Afghan populace, one would think any plan for withdrawal would make counternarcotics central to a lasting (or, at least, plausible) strategy for peace.</p>\n\n<p>Even granting a pass to the execution and effectiveness of our counternarcotics program, as the inspector general noted, \u201cthe United States does not have a comprehensive anti-corruption strategy even though Afghanistan is universally recognized as one of the most corrupt countries in the world. The narcotics trade is fueling that corruption.\u201d In September, SIGAR, as Sopko\u2019s office is known, released an <a href=\"http://www.sigar.mil/pdf/alerts/SIGAR-SP-13-9.pdf\">extensive and wholly depressing report</a> noting that the United States has no clear strategy on fighting corruption and no metric for success. Plans had previously been drafted to do just such things, but were never finalized and eventually found a home in some drawer at the State Department; the proposals have since expired.</p>\n\n<p>In place of a coherent strategy to fight corruption, officials adopted guidelines from two documents: the Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework and the U.S. Civil-Military Strategic Framework for Afghanistan. The inspector general studied the documents, and noticed something conspicuously absent: \u201cspecific goals and objectives with measurable outcomes for anti-corruption activities against which the U.S. government can measure its progress.\u201d</p>\n\n<aside class=\"pullquote instapaper_ignore\">The DEA is soon to become yet another U.S. agency ensconced at our fortress in Kabul, sealed behind Roman testudo-style blast walls.</aside><p>Arguably, this is part of the U.S. government\u2019s broader plan to declare victory and go home. After all, if your plan lacks stated objectives, and elides both a standard of success and a way of measuring progress, who can really say we <em>didn\u2019t</em> win the war? Who\u2019s to say our anti-corruption efforts haven\u2019t been a resounding success? Reality, it seems, is whatever we decree it to be.</p>\n\n<p>And still it\u2019s worse than that.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier this month, SIGAR <a href=\"http://www.sigar.mil/pdf/audits/SIGAR%2014-16-AR.pdf\">released a report</a> on Afghanistan\u2019s banking sector. \u201cForensic audits of major commercial banks in Afghanistan have identified systemic weaknesses in many areas of banking governance and operations, including personnel capacity, internal controls, accounting, credit analysis, and compliance with regulations,\u201d the study noted. \u201c[The central bank of Afghanistan\u2019s] ongoing limitations and inability to conduct robust oversight allows such weaknesses in Afghan banks to remain unchecked, heightening the risk of another banking crisis.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>In other words, except for everything a bank is supposed to do, and every safeguard a bank is supposed to have, the banks in Afghanistan are great. This is particularly problematic in the context of the illicit drug trade, as corrupt banks make following money trails difficult, and lend themselves to money-laundering operations\u2014a known and ongoing problem in the country.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n\n<p>Security in Afghanistan is deteriorating and law enforcement is a mess. Even the prisons have become a problem. In 2009, the Counternarcotics Justice Center in Afghanistan opened prisons specifically built for drug offenders. Within three months, the jails were filled with \u201clow-profile detainees,\u201d leaving no room for\u2014you guessed it!\u2014drug offenders. At any rate, the Counternarcotics Justice Center lacks procedures to handle a high caseload, which isn\u2019t a big deal\u2014unless your country produces 90 percent of the world\u2019s opium.</p>\n\n<p>As the U.S. military withdraws from Afghanistan, so too is the Drug Enforcement Agency. Forget advising forces in Helmand and Kandahar provinces\u2014the twin poppy capitals of the world. As the inspector general reports, \u201cwithout military support for security, intelligence, medical evacuation, and tactical air control for high-risk operations, DEA will have little ability to extend its operations beyond Kabul.\u201d The upshot is the DEA is soon to become yet another U.S. agency ensconced at our fortress in Kabul, sealed behind Roman testudo-style blast walls and fences draped with anti-sniper netting.</p><p>\nSopko concluded his testimony with an ominous assessment of things to come. \u201cThe people I spoke with in Afghanistan in my last few trips talked about two possible outcomes following the 2014 transition in Afghanistan: a successful modern state, or an insurgent state,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHowever, there is a third possibility: a narco-criminal state. Absent effective counternarcotics programs and Afghan political will to seriously tackle this grave problem, that third outcome may become a reality.\u201d</p>\n        \n            </div>\n\n</div></body></html>"}, {"source": "http://rss.csmonitor.com/feeds/world", "text": "India's Foreign Ministry announced it was expelling a US diplomat from New Delhi.

The US court indictment papers charge that Khobragade lied on her visa papers and made her maid work 100-hour weeks for about one-seventh the US minimum wage.To some Indian observers, the delay in resolving the situation suggests a dismissiveness toward India that is troubling. \u201cThe solution reached now could have been reached several days ago. But to let the issue fester for a month, for a country the United States calls a strategic partner, is unusual,\u201d says Lalit Mansingh, former Indian ambassador to the United States. \"That it was allowed to become so messy shows the United States doesn't care about India and makes you wonder if the Indo-U.S. strategic relationship is still alive or not.\" Repairing the relationship will not be easy, because India has gone to extreme limits in applying local laws to American diplomats in response to the US insistence that local laws apply to Indian consular staff. These include asking the US Embassy not to host film screenings without a license, barring them from importing alcohol, and effectively ordering that a club run by the American embassy be shut down.\u201cThis incident demonstrates that the relationship existed more at the political level than at the diplomatic level. It is as if the diplomats on both sides decided the relationship wasn't strategic enough to show more courtesy and grace,\u201d says Samir Saran, vice president of the Observer Research Foundation, a New Delhi think tank. The relationship of the United States with New Delhi has warmed significantly since President Clinton visited India in 2000. Prior to that, India had been closer to the former Soviet Union, and it defied the world with nuclear tests in 1997. India-US ties grew after 9/11, though more recently, strains have emerged over India's delayed implementation of the India-US civil nuclear energy deal and the slowing down of trade relations.Chances are slim that the relationship will return to normal in a hurry. US Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz postponed his trip to India this month, India will hold general elections this spring, and the opposition Bhartiya Janata Party's candidate for the post of prime minister, Narendra Modi, is currently barred from getting a US visa for allegedly looking the other way as Hindu mobs killed at least 1,200 Muslims in Gujarat in 2002.

Kevin Lamarque/ReutersDemocrats have said for years that Obamacare will get more popular as people begin to see its benefits. Now we'll find out whether that's true. Many of the Affordable Care Act's most popular provisions take effect Wednesday. Beginning this week, insurers cannot use a preexisting condition as a reason to deny someone coverage or charge a higher premium. New insurance policies take effect that must cover certain benefits. And, biggest of all, new tax subsidies kick in to help low-income consumers cover the cost of their premiums. All of this is happening amid stubbornly bad\u2014and, according to some polls, falling\u2014public approval of the healthcare law. The latest tracking poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation put its favorability rating at 34 percent, compared with 48 percent who had an unfavorable view. Obamacare's approval ratings have been upside-down for years, and Democrats had all but given up trying to turn the numbers around until the law's most popular provisions took effect. The botched rollout of Healthcare.gov made matters worse. Approval of the law, and President Obama's own approval ratings, sank as the federal enrollment website sputtered. Administration officials say their biggest concern during the site's early troubles was that people would give up on the Obamacare \"brand\" and simply wouldn't come back to the site once it began working. That hasn't happened. According to the Health and Human Services Department, more than 975,000 people selected and enrolled in a plan through Healthcare.gov this month. The total for all 50 states is now above 2 million\u2014still shy of the 3.3 million sign-ups HHS initially expected to receive by the end of the year, but rapidly picking up steam. One potential problem for the administration, though, is that people don't associate new benefits they might like with the healthcare law. As Democratic strategists have noted, coverage under the ACA isn't an easily identifiable benefit like Medicare or Social Security. It's private insurance, paid for in part by a subsidy that goes directly to the insurance company. Many individual pieces of the ACA, including many of the policies that take effect January 1, are popular on their own. The administration has already struggled with earlier benefits\u2014namely rebates paid by insurance companies\u2014that poll well but which people don't seem to connect to Obamacare. And that's assuming people like the coverage they'll get under the law. In order to keep premiums low, many insurance companies have limited the network of providers they'll cover in new policies, meaning some people who had their plans canceled might not be able to keep their doctors. And consumers who benefited most from the pre-Obamacare individual market\u2014young, healthy, reasonably affluent men\u2014will see their premiums for coverage rise under the new rules.

The bombings struck neighborhoods around Baghdad. A car bomb exploded near a restaurant in the western neighborhood of Mansour, killing four people and wounding 12, the police said. Another exploded near a bus station in eastern Baghdad, killing four people and wounding six, the authorities said. In northern Baghdad, the police said a blast near a hospital killed four people and wounded eight. Three other bombs across western Baghdad killed eight people and wounded 26, officials said. Some inmates from a juvenile prison near one blast escaped, and the authorities sealed the area to search for them. Police said mortar shells landed near a residential area in the Adil neighborhood, killing three people and wounding nine.

A double bombing near a market in the northern city of Kirkuk also killed one person and wounded 15, police said. Iraqi security forces and allied Sunni tribesmen have been trying to recapture Anbar.

This week he announced that France will reduce its troops by another third next month to some 1,600, saying, \u201cwe now have the situation in hand.\u201d Skip to next paragraph Subscribe Today to the Monitor Click Here for your FREE 30 DAYS ofThe Christian Science MonitorWeekly Digital Edition But even if militarily France can declare success at the one-year anniversary of its intervention, Mali is still at a daunting crossroads: facing poverty, corruption, ethnic tensions, and violence that threaten to undo gains made to secure the country. \u201cThe military objective was a success, but the situation is fragile,\u201d says Antonin Tisseron, a research fellow with the Thomas More Institute in Paris who authored a report looking at the challenges Mali faces at the one-year mark. \u201cPolitically, there is everything left to do.\u201d'We don't have progression'That sense of uncertainty is palpable in a place called \u201cLittle Bamako,\u201d named after the capital of Mali, in Paris. It is a residence for Malians who have fled the country, located in an eastern suburb of Paris, but it's also a hang-out for the local diaspora. The courtyard at the center of the low-level highrise is a bustling place. On a recent day, a young boy wearing a blue apron has his hair trimmed in a barber's chair set up at the edge of the enclosure. Around him, vendors hawk peanuts in their shells and piles of potatoes. A cafe off to the side is filled with men standing and eating their breakfasts: coffee and slim baguettes or croissants.A year ago, when France intervened in Mali at the country's request, this place was brimming with relief, recounts Adama Dabo, a cafe patron and construction worker who has been in France nearly 30 years. Now, he says, people are much more tentative about what has been accomplished and how possible success is for the tasks ahead.\u201cI applauded when France intervened, just like everyone else,\u201d he says. But now he looks wearily at his homeland: a place with continued threats of violence, a lack of infrastructure and industry, and political tensions that have failed to find meaningful solutions. \u201cWe don't have progression,\u201d Mr. Dabo says.A popular missionFrance's leaders have focused on what has been accomplished in the year since the mission \u2013 dubbed Operation Serval \u2013 sent 5,000 troops to battle al Qaeda-linked rebels in Mali's north. The rebels had gained strength due to the political instability that followed a coup in March 2012.On a New Year's visit to Mali, France's Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said the country was \u201cliberated\u201d \u2013 a view widely shared by the international community, including Malian central authorities. \u201cA year ago, they were torturing people and chopping off hands here,\u201d he said.Operation Serval did help undo the jihadi infrastructure in northern Mali, with several hundred extremists killed or having surrendered. The operation netted logistics warehouses, weapons caches, and training centers. Another turning point in Mali was the national election this summer that ushered in the presidency of Ibrahim Boubacar Keita.The intervention was widely supported by Malians, who hailed the arrival of troops, as well as the French public. \u201cThe intervention in Mali, a great success for France\u201d is the title of a recent piece by defense analyst Jean-Dominique Merchet in his blog Secret Defense, summing up the majority mood. \u201cA year ago, Mali was a country in complete downward spiral,\u201d he writes. \u201cIn the first days of 2014, the situation is radically different.\u201dIt continues to be one of the sole popular actions that President Hollande has taken since he became president in May 2012. The French polling firm BVA released a survey in April, three months after the intervention, asking respondents what actions the president has taken that will have an important impact, and Mali ranked no. 1, at 63 percent.Support for French action has remained high, even after the deaths of French troops \u2013 seven were killed during Operation Serval \u2013 and two journalists who were ambushed and killed while preparing a report for Radio France Internationale (RFI) in November.What's next?That tragedy raised questions about how lasting the peace will be in Mali. Some jihadist groups have regrouped, revealing the fragile security situation, says Mr. Tisseron. And some 1,000 French troops are expected to stay long-term, working along side UN and African-trained forces.But Tisseron says that beyond security, rebuilding Mali is the next \u2013 and more pressing \u2013 challenge. The political differences that led to the March coup still remain deeply entrenched, and Mali is mired in poverty and corruption.Koly Traorre, the barista at the cafe in \u201cLittle Bamako,\u201d says the country needs continued international support, whether from French forces or the community at large.\u201cThe country is not stable, especially the north,\u201d he says. \u201cThe north deserves to be free, like any place else in the world.\u201d", "published": "", "tags": null, "title": "Mali, one year later: France's mission accomplished \u2013 but much left to do", "updated": "", "author": null, "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2014/0111/Mali-one-year-later-France-s-mission-accomplished-but-much-left-to-do", "_id": 69606298, "html": "<html><body><div><p>France's military efforts against Mali's Islamic rebels are widely regarded as successful, both in Paris and Bamako.

If my husband had trouble with the lawn mower, our friend would say, \u201cI\u2019ll take a look,\u201d and after tinkering for a few minutes, the mower would be humming \u2014 put, put, put \u2014 away.If I\u2019d ordered furniture that needed assembling, he was our man. \u201cIt was supposed to be easy,\u201d I\u2019d say. He\u2019d glance at the nuts and bolts scattered on the floor and in a few minutes \u2026 viola! Everything fit perfectly. Each time, my husband and I would smile at each other sheepishly. My husband was everything to me, but he didn\u2019t have a handy bone in his body. For that matter, neither did I. Can you believe this guy? we\u2019d say to each other. He actually liked doing this stuff.We\u2019d insist on paying him for larger jobs and he charged a reasonable rate, a friend\u2019s discount you could call it. The work he did was always professional quality. When he painted, he never left a spot anywhere, except on the wall.Our friend worked on his house in summer and winter. While I\u2019d spend a free hour sitting on my porch, watching the cardinals in the bird bath, he was the kind of man who was always hammering and sawing something; he put an addition on his house all by himself.I\u2019d reciprocate; it wasn\u2019t a one-way street. When he inherited tools and needed a place to store them we offered our two-car garage and they filled it, leaving just enough room for our lawn mower. We let him store other belongings until he built his own garage, which took a year.Eventually, we struck a deal: I\u2019d cook; he\u2019d fix. We even shook hands on it. I made containers of spaghetti sauce, brisket, casseroles; now my freezer looked like the garage: overstuffed. When I\u2019d pass his way, I\u2019d take him a container or two.He was in his 50s, the same as my husband, but had two marriages behind him. Both men were nice looking, but my husband was handsome on the inside.But with our friend there were things going on that we didn\u2019t like.He had a girlfriend who visited, but there were other women, too, although his steady didn\u2019t know about them. He\u2019d keep us posted so we wouldn\u2019t say the wrong thing: \u201cThere\u2019s another girl coming this weekend,\u201d he\u2019d say. It bothered us that when the regular girlfriend visited, he let her work like a mule. She\u2019d drag out the lawn furniture and beat the carpet with a broom. \u201cThis guy\u2019s too much,\u201d my husband would say.Our marriage was unusually good, I think. Even after 20 years, my eyes lit up when my husband would walk into the room. \u201cI just love living with you,\u201d I\u2019d say. Our friend seemed happy for us.Then my husband had a massive coronary. It was after he returned home from a ballgame. I greeted him at the door with a fresh baked treat. \u201cI made Irish soda bread muffins,\u201d I said. He enjoyed his snack and we retired for the night, ending with a sweet kiss. Twenty minutes later he screamed, \u201cSuz!\u201d Then silence. There hadn\u2019t been a single sign or symptom before this.Our friend attended the funeral and did chores for me in the days that followed: turned off the water, put away the hoses and changed the filter in the heater. I was unhinged; it was all I could do to breathe, but still, I remembered to give him a container of chicken cacciatore.Two months later he and I went to a local bar for wings. We\u2019d been there before, but my husband had been with us. I couldn\u2019t eat, just sat on the bar stool and was quiet, but I noticed that he seemed to be enjoying himself. In fact, he said so. \u201cI had a good time tonight,\u201d he said. Good time? I thought. I felt like a dummy on a bar stool.Several weeks later we talked about having dinner again. I made it clear that we\u2019d be going Dutch, but he insisted on treating, which made me uneasy. When he came in the back door, he presented me with a gift bag. My fingers poked through the tissue paper and pulled out a toy for my dog. She ran around the house squeaking it, and although I enjoyed her antics, I had a sick feeling in my stomach. Our friend had never brought her a toy before, never so much as given her a bone.\u201cThere\u2019s something else,\u201d he said, so I fished in the bag and pulled out a camisole, clearly an undergarment, undoubtedly, something for a lover\u2019s eyes. Three months later? How despicable, I thought. The camisole felt slimy, reptilian; I was surprised it hadn\u2019t crawled out of the bag. It was all I could do not to flick it away from me. I knew it would be harder yet, to exterminate it from my mind.Our friend\u2019s smile seemed lascivious; his eyes were glazed. He was picturing me in the camisole, I thought. He said, \u201cI like white lace.\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, and we continued to dinner. I knew if I broke our plans, I\u2019d be forced to discuss it and I wasn\u2019t ready: I had a brain freeze.Many weeks passed. No sign of him. My anger festered until I ran into him again one holiday weekend. And then it popped. \u201cYou were my friend!\u201d I screamed. \u201cHow could you give me that sleazy gift?\u201d\u201cI just wanted to cheer you up,\u201d he said. \u201cI meant nothing by it.\u201d\u201cYou are so lucky we\u2019ve been friends,\u201d I said. \u201cIf I was a mean girl, I\u2019d shake that camisole in your poor girlfriend\u2019s face and yell, \u201cLook what he gave me to cheer me up after my husband died!\u201dHis head swiveled like Linda Blair\u2019s in \u201cThe Exorcist.\u201d He apologized profusely, but didn\u2019t look me in the eye. Since then, if we run into each other, we simply nod and go our own way.", "published": "Mon, 27 Jan 2014 06:00:05 GMT", "tags": ["Baby Boomers", "Deaths (Obituaries)", "Widows and Widowers", "Friendship", "Marriages"], "title": "My Story: The Friend, Till I Was Widowed", "updated": "Mon, 27 Jan 2014 06:00:05 GMT", "author": "By SUZI OLDEN", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/27/booming/the-friend-till-i-was-widowed.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "_id": 70259785, "html": "<html><body><div><article id=\"story\" class=\"story theme-main\">\n\n    <header class=\"story-header\">\n                <div class=\"story-meta\">\n            <button class=\"button comments-button  theme-kicker\"/>            \n            <h1 itemprop=\"headline\" class=\"story-heading\">The Friend, Till I Was Widowed</h1>\n\n                        \n        </div>\n    </header>\n\n    \n    <div class=\"lede-container\">\n        <figure class=\"media photo lede layout-large-horizontal\" data-media-action=\"modal\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope=\"\" itemid=\"http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/21/booming/21mystory-booming-friend/21mystory-booming-friend-master675.jpg\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\">\n    <div class=\"image\">\n            <img src=\"http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/21/booming/21mystory-booming-friend/21mystory-booming-friend-master675.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"media-viewer-candidate\" data-mediaviewer-src=\"http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/21/booming/21mystory-booming-friend/21mystory-booming-friend-superJumbo.jpg\" data-mediaviewer-caption=\"\" data-mediaviewer-credit=\"Katherine Streeter\" itemprop=\"url\" itemid=\"http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/21/booming/21mystory-booming-friend/21mystory-booming-friend-master675.jpg\"/>\n            <meta itemprop=\"identifier\" content=\"http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/21/booming/21mystory-booming-friend/21mystory-booming-friend-master675.jpg\"/>\n            <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"421\"/>\n            <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"675\"/>\n    </div>\n        <figcaption class=\"caption\" itemprop=\"description\"><span class=\"caption-text\"/> <span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">Katherine Streeter</span></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n        \n    </div>\n\n    \n\n            \n    <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"234\" data-total-count=\"234\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">You couldn\u2019t ask for a more helpful friend.

It bothered us that when the regular girlfriend visited, he let her work like a mule.

Our friend seemed happy for us.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"379\" data-total-count=\"2992\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Then my husband had a massive coronary. It was after he returned home from a ballgame. I greeted him at the door with a fresh baked treat. \u201cI made Irish soda bread muffins,\u201d I said.

We\u2019d been there before, but my husband had been with us. I couldn\u2019t eat, just sat on the bar stool and was quiet, but I noticed that he seemed to be enjoying himself. In fact, he said so. \u201cI had a good time tonight,\u201d he said. Good time? I thought.

I made it clear that we\u2019d be going Dutch, but he insisted on treating, which made me uneasy. When he came in the back door, he presented me with a gift bag. My fingers poked through the tissue paper and pulled out a toy for my dog. She ran around the house squeaking it, and although I enjoyed her antics, I had a sick feeling in my stomach. Our friend had never brought her a toy before, never so much as given her a bone.</p><aside class=\"marginalia comments-marginalia  selected-comment-marginalia\" data-marginalia-type=\"sprinkled\"/><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"410\" data-total-count=\"4512\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u201cThere\u2019s something else,\u201d he said, so I fished in the bag and pulled out a camisole, clearly an undergarment, undoubtedly, something for a lover\u2019s eyes. Three months later? How despicable, I thought. The camisole felt slimy, reptilian; I was surprised it hadn\u2019t crawled out of the bag. It was all I could do not to flick it away from me. I knew it would be harder yet, to exterminate it from my mind.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"143\" data-total-count=\"4655\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Our friend\u2019s smile seemed lascivious; his eyes were glazed.

Larry W. Smith/European Pressphoto Agency FORT WORTH \u2014 A Texas judge ruled on Friday that a Fort Worth hospital must remove the life support of a pregnant brain-dead woman, siding with the husband and family in a case that has drawn national attention.The judge, R. H. Wallace Jr. of State District Court in Tarrant County, ordered John Peter Smith Hospital to pronounce the woman, Marlise Mu\u00f1oz, dead, and remove her from life support by 5 p.m. on Monday.Ms. Mu\u00f1oz, 33, has been on life support since Nov. 26, when she collapsed on her kitchen floor from what appeared to be a blood clot in her lung.

Most of it anyway. I'm still picking my way through the conclusion. At any rate, I want to focus today on one of the minor, but gripping, themes running through Bloodlands--power and social invention. Whenever American racism enters our field of discussion, it's fairly common for liberals, like me, to point out that our concept of race is a social construct. I've tried to unpack the logic behind this before, but I think this is the sort of thing said so much, and perhaps sometimes said in such a flip manner, that it's become clich\u00e9. I think it's important to say that our modern construct of race isn't just a \"social construct,\" but that it is--itself--a racist construct, and as such has always depended less on ancestry, then the naked exercise of power. When Frederick Douglass died, his wife Helen wrote: It is easy to say, as has been carelessly said by some in commenting upon Mr. Douglass' life and career, that the intellectual power, the ambition, the talent which he displayed, were inheritances from his white father; that the colored strain disappeared except as it gave the hue to his skin ; and that to all intents and purposes Frederick Douglass was a white man. That America was full of black people, like Douglass, with white parents did nothing to dissuade. The point was to make Douglass, and his many accomplishments, accord comfortably with the dictates of the day. When Hermann Goring needed to justify the service of \"The Jew Nazi\" Erhard Milch he asserted, \"I decide who is a Jew and who is Aryan.\" Goring was echoing the words of Austrian anti-Semite Karl Lueger who'd denounced Budapest as \"Judapest,\" then turned around and justified his many friendships with Jews by claiming, \"I decide who is a Jew.\" Lueger and Goring were right. The \"Jew\" in Lueger's mind, the \"black race\" in the American mind, were little more than totems employed to legitimize injustice. Surely Jewish people (much like black people) exist in our world with their own culture and traditions. But these were not the Jews of Goring's imagination Likewise in Poland: At Ciepiel\u00f3w, after a pitched battle, three hundred Polish prisoners were taken. Despite all the evidence, the German commander declared that these captured soldiers were partisans, irregular fighters unprotected by the laws of war. The Polish officers and soldiers, wearing full uniform, were astonished. The Germans made them disrobe. Now they looked more like partisans. All of them were gunned down and thrown in a ditch. In the short Polish campaign, there were at least sixty-three such actions. No fewer than three thousand Polish prisoners of war were murdered... As one general maintained, \u201cGermans are the masters, and Poles are the slaves.\u201d The army leadership knew that Hitler\u2019s goals for the campaign were anything but conventional. As the chief of staff summarized, it was \u201cthe intention of the Leader to destroy and exterminate the Polish people.\u201d Soldiers had been prepared to see the Polish civilian population as devious and subhuman. One of them was so convinced of Polish hostility that he interpreted a Pole\u2019s death grimace as the expression of irrational hatred of Germans. The point here is invention. The reality of Polish soldiers undercut Nazi needs and so they were vanished and refashioned into \"partisans.\" One thinks of Howell Cobb writing during the Civil War, \"If slaves seem good soldiers, our whole theory of slavery is wrong.\" Or Kate Stone, after hearing of a Confederate defeat at the hands of black soldiers, writing \"there must be some mistake.\" In Cracow, Polish intellectual accomplishment clashed with the Nazi image of the country and so the Nazis sought turned to destruction. \"The entire professoriate of the renowned university was sent to concentration camps,\" writes Snyder. \"The statue of Adam Mickiewicz, the great romantic poet, was pulled down from its pedestal on the Market Square.\" In post-war Communist Poland, the art of invention continued. The country sought to purge Jews from \"public life and positions of political influence.\" There was just one problem: ....who was a Jew? In 1968, students with Jewish names or Stalinist parents received disproportionate attention in the press. Polish authorities used anti-Semitism to separate the rest of the population from the students, organizing huge rallies of workers and soldiers. The Polish working class became, in the pronouncements of the country\u2019s leaders, the ethnically Polish working class. But matters were not so simple. The Gomu\u0142ka regime was happy to use the Jewish label to rid itself of criticism in general. A Jew, by the party definition, was not always someone whose parents were Jewish. Characteristic of the campaign was a certain vagueness about Jews: often a \u201cZionist\u201d was simply an intellectual or someone unfavorable to the regime. When I was young man, I studied history at Howard University. Much of my studies were focused on the black diaspora, and thus white racism.

Photograph: Eduardo Verdugo/AP The Mexican drug war hotspot of Michoac\u00e1n is simmering with tension in the wake of deadly clashes between soldiers and self-defence groups that have left at least two dead.Efforts of the Mexican security forces to disarm vigilantes waging a battle against local cartels were met with violent resistance by the groups, who said that dropping their weapons would leave them at the mercy of the Knights Templar drug cartel.Local media reported that 12 people have been killed in the clashes, including unarmed civilians, though only two deaths have so far been officially confirmed.The disarmament drive follows Monday's federal government announcement of a new concerted effort to restore order to the Tierra Caliente, or Hot Land, region of Michoac\u00e1n that in recent weeks has appeared on the verge of civil war after the vigilante movement there launched an effort to surround the regional capital, Apatzing\u00e1n, which is considered a cartel stronghold.\"It is not right that the government is going after us when we are on red alert because of a possible attack by the Knights Templar,\" vigilante leader Estanislao Beltr\u00e1n told MVS radio. \"We are not going to give up our weapons or sit down and negotiate with the government until they arrest the cartel leaders.\"Beltr\u00e1n said the worst incident occurred after a military convoy of 60 to 80 soldiers disarmed vigilantes guarding the town of Ant\u00fanez. He said thousands of enraged residents blocked the convoy's departure route demanding the return of the weapons, after which soldiers opened fire killing four people, including an 11-year-old girl.\"The soldiers opened fire on the people,\" Beltr\u00e1n said. \"The government doesn't want to understand what is really happening here.

Photograph: Dan Dennison/Getty Images The leader of Europe's most powerful far-right party held a rally in London on Sunday, despite calls to ban him from the UK and strong opposition from anti-racism activists.About 100 supporters of the Hungarian Jobbik party, which has been accused of stirring up hatred of Jews and Roma, gathered at Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park to hear G\u00e1bor Vona speak.The venue of the rally was changed after Jobbik supporters were confronted in central London by more than 100 members of Unite Against Fascism and other groups. The home secretary, Theresa May, resisted calls last week to ban Vona from entering the country to hold the rally, which comes before elections in Hungary and on the eve of Holocaust Memorial Day in Britain.Demonstrators on both sides began arriving at Holborn \u2013 Jobbik's expected meeting place \u2013 at around lunchtime. They quickly blocked exits from the London Underground station, forcing most of the Jobbik supporters to stay inside.After the Hungarian contingent retreated back down to the train platforms, most of the anti-fascist activists left, apparently believing the rally to have been cancelled. However, it went ahead with relatively little opposition further west.Sara Liptai, a 60-year-old Hungarian who lives in the UK, protested against the rally. She said there was danger to Britain in giving a platform to the leader of a party that has previously called for a register of Jewish people who pose a \"national security risk\".She said: \"They gain legitimacy by being able to speak freely here in a properly democratic setup. That is quite dangerous, for them to believe that it is OK.\"Another Hungarian, Eva Keleman, who is in her 50s, said she wanted to protest against the \"gathering force and power\" of Jobbik, and other extreme-right movements. She said: \"We are protesting against all sorts of discrimination, racism and any rightwing movements.\"Jobbik supporters said they were not authorised to speak to the press, but one \u2013 who did not give his name \u2013 said: \"There is either democracy, or there isn't.\" Vona spoke to his supporters for about 20 minutes.The London assembly member and former Labour MP Andrew Dismore was vocal in his opposition to Vona's arrival in the UK.

Jobbik party is a racist party which targets Roma, it wants to segregate them into ghettos, and it targets Jewish people.\"This is so reminiscent in Hungary of what happened in Nazi Germany in the 1930s and it should not be allowed to continue in the UK.\"Dismore said the home secretary had made a grave mistake by not acting on a Hope Not Hate petition with more 14,000 signatures that called for Vona to be excluded from the UK.Unite Against Fascism's joint national secretary Sabby Dhalu said: \"Jobbik's fascist hatred has no place in a modern society here, or in the rest of Europe.

The revolution led to a power vacuum that was quickly filled by the powerful and long-lived dictatorship of Fidel Castro. Fidel ruled Cuba until 2006, when, citing health reasons, he transferred power to his brother, current President Ra\u00fal Castro. (In the photo above, Ra\u00fal participates in a ceremony to mark the anniversary in Santiago de Cuba.) Aside from the fact that Cuba's socialist state has managed to endure for 55 years, there is little for Ra\u00fal to celebrate. Cuba's overall income and caloric consumption per capita today are not that much higher than they were in 1958. In 1958, Cuba was at the top among Latin American nations in terms of the number of newspapers, TV stations, TV sets, telephones, and automobiles per capita; today, it is at the bottom. The government claims that independence from Washington was a significant achievement, but today the Revolution is embarrassingly dependent on Miami, which in 2013 sent remittances amounting to $5.1 billion, enough to provide $1000 for every Cuban worker in a country where the average annual salary is less than $260. Cuba is a developmental anomaly. It has some of the highest numbers in average years of schooling in the world (as is typical in totalitarian states), but also has one of the lowest economic growth rates in the world. It is hard to find a comparable case: typically, these higher averages go hand-in-hand with higher incomes. Many blame the U.S. embargo for Cuba's economic underperformance. But the embargo has always been offset by the massive subsidies that the Soviet Union provided during the Cold War and that the petro-state of Venezuela has provided since 2001. And yet, despite these direct subsidies (and Cuba's newly burgeoning trade relations with countries around the world), the state is still unable to produce anything efficiently. Cuba's only value-added export is the talent of its people, who have been emigrating in droves for the past 55 years despite the lack of civil strife since the mid-1960s. This year, the government liberalized exit visas (though it did not lower the cost of passports), leading to a 35 percent increase in departures relative to 2012. So far, only 45 percent of those who managed to \"travel abroad\" have decided to return. Medical doctors also leave in large numbers, usually as part of the state's foreign missions. But Cuban doctors often take the order to go abroad happily: they seem to prefer working in the slums of Venezuela, Brazil, and Haiti to the \"socialist paradise\" they call home, even though they are paid only a fraction of what the Cuban government charges for these services. The Cuban economy's dysfunctional nature has not escaped Ra\u00fal Castro. In fact, the economy's trials have become a favorite theme in his speeches. Every time he has a chance to talk about local conditions, Ra\u00fal admonishes some aspect of the status quo: the \"inefficiency\" of state-owned companies, the \"laziness and proclivity to stealing\" of Cuban workers, the \"corruption\" of managers and bureaucrats, the \"absenteeism\" of teachers, the \"complacency\" of the party's leadership, the decline of \"morals\" and even \"manners\" of Cuba's youth. While Fidel Castro was the denier-in-chief, famous for speeches that were groundlessly triumphalist and blind to the regime's catastrophes, Ra\u00fal does nothing but complain about the system. Whereas Fidel was the Revolution's greatest propagandist, Ra\u00fal has become the Revolution's most outspoken fault-finder. Ra\u00fal Castro's attention to the system's flaws is no doubt a breath of fresh air for Cubans tired of living in la-la land. It has compelled Ra\u00fal to introduce some of the most sweeping market-oriented reforms of the last 55 years. But the problem is that Cuba's president is acting both as a reformer and a stalwart of the long-standing revolutionary regime. Ra\u00fal wants to reform and preserve the system, and this is producing hesitant and confusing reforms. Ra\u00fal's deep roots have made him as repressive as he is open, limiting the economy and curtailing private enterprise. On the one hand, Ra\u00fal has created more opportunities for Cubans to become self-employed, to use remittances from exiles, and to buy and sell their assets such as homes and vehicles. These are huge reforms. Today, a record number of Cubans -- 444,109, to be exact -- have obtained self-employment licenses, and a real estate market is burgeoning for the first time since the revolution. From a fiscal point of view, these economic reforms have been successful: fiscal revenues from the private sector are up by 18 percent since 2011. But as is typical of old-line communists, and especially of his brother, Fidel, Ra\u00fal remains apprehensive about the private sector. He worries that the private sector could become too large and thus able to challenge the state's stranglehold on society. Therefore, rather than boosting the private sector with further reforms, the government is holding fast to restrictive policies. Key areas of the economy remain closed to competition. Self-employment is still banned in most professions that require advanced skills, such as engineering, architecture, software development, and the medical sciences. Large-scale hiring is prohibited, so private enterprise is limited to micro firms and family businesses. Credit for the private sector is virtually non-existent. The self-employed continue to be overregulated; many are closing their businesses because they cannot afford taxes or find enough customers, since the bulk of the population is still employed by the state and receives meager wages. Consequently, the self-employed sector remains far below the goal of 1.5 million individuals set by Ra\u00fal when he launched his reforms in 2011. Ra\u00fal's reformer/conservative duality is equally visible in politics. He has expanded the freedom of expression in a number of decrees that liberalize access to cell phones and the Internet -- major steps in the expansion of speech opportunities. Ra\u00fal has also voluntarily supported a new amendment to Cuba's constitution that establishes a five-year term limit -- a move that is remarkable even by contemporary Latin American standards, where presidents are wont to relax rather than restrict term limits. Earlier in 2013, he said this would be his last term, which means that he intends to leave office in 2018. And internationally, Cuba is fully cooperating with peace talks in Colombia, a process that is vital for U.S. interests in South America. But meanwhile, Ra\u00fal has also increased Cuba's political repression. Arbitrary detentions have increased from 2,074 in 2010 to more than 5,300 in 2013. The state arrested more than 909 human rights activists in October 2013 alone. This included some members of the Ladies in White, a peaceful, pro-human rights women's association fighting for the rights of Cuban prisoners. Cuba Archive, an organization that monitors human rights, argues that under Ra\u00fal's government, the state has overseen at least 166 deaths and disappearances, all politically-motivated, including the possible assassination of Cuba's most important civil rights leader, Oswaldo Pay\u00e1, in 2012. Politically, therefore, Cuba is not moving forward, but backwards. Maintaining his old-line roots, the Cuban president also continues to privilege the military over any other sector. During his tenure as minister of defense, Ra\u00fal oversaw military operations, and after becoming president, he accelerated Cuba's transition to a pseudo-military regime by appointing key military officials to his cabinet, often to replace civilian fidelistas to consolidate the transition to his own government. Ra\u00fal also increased the military's control of industries in Cuba that engage in foreign trade. And though Ra\u00fal is critical of almost every sector, he never criticizes the military. In fact, he is openly supportive of it. Just this year, the government launched the construction of three new \"military cities,\" state-of-the-art housing development projects for members of the Armed Forces. In political science, we are not that surprised by duality. From Russia to China to the Arab World, new leaders often emerge who try to act simultaneously as reformers and old-liners, hoping to overhaul the status quo while maintaining the main elements of the existing regime. While political scientists expect one side to prevail, they are used to the idea of conflicted leaders. But in Washington, this duality only worsens the divide between those who favor rapprochement and those who oppose it. Ra\u00fal's duality raises hope among some groups who feel the time is ripe for the United States to open to Cuba, and vice versa. But others see Ra\u00fal the old-liner, and they become even more adamant about vetoing any efforts to rebuild the ties between the two states. The result is a continued impasse in U.S.-Cuba relations. Ra\u00fal Castro seems to be fine with this middling approach. Just two weeks after the famous controversial handshake between Obama and Ra\u00fal during Nelson Mandela's funeral, Ra\u00fal gave a speech where he addressed U.S.-Cuban relations. Rather than take the opportunity to lambast the empire, as his brother would have done, Ra\u00fal stated that officials from both countries have been meeting productively on immigration and other issues, proving that bilateral relations can be \"civilized.\" In his tone and approach, Ra\u00fal has shown a pragmatic and even self-satisfied side. But he also said this: \"We don't demand that the United States change its political and social system, nor will we negotiate with ours.\" With this simple line, Ra\u00fal displayed the core of his conservatism. His duty as supreme leader of Cuba, he once affirmed, is to ensure the survival of the system. He won't pay the price of better relations with the United States if that means system change. Ra\u00fal's words were also a warning to his compatriots: namely, that his government is uninterested in real change. For Cubans who found hope in Ra\u00fal's initial reforms, this statement is hard to swallow -- not just because of its innate conservatism, but because it comes from the very same man who makes, at every opportunity, the strongest case for a system overhaul than any Cuban official has made in decades. At some point, Ra\u00fal Castro might find himself forced to choose between reform and tradition. While it is common for leaders to want to be reformers and old-liners at the same time, they eventually select one approach over the other. Reforms have a tendency to be self-generating: more freedoms lead to demands for more freedoms, and this in turn means a deeper overhaul of the system. Ra\u00fal will need to decide to either yield to these demands or to block them to preserve the system that he and his brothers founded 55 years ago. So far, he hasn't faced this choice. The freedom to be that ambivalent was probably Ra\u00fal's biggest cause for celebration on the anniversary last week -- but that freedom won't last forever.

The revolution led to a power vacuum that was quickly filled&#13;\nby the powerful and long-lived dictatorship of Fidel Castro. Fidel ruled Cuba&#13;\nuntil 2006, when, citing health reasons, he transferred power to his brother,&#13;\ncurrent President Ra\u00fal Castro. (In the photo above, Ra\u00fal participates in a ceremony to mark the anniversary in Santiago de Cuba.)  &#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nAside&#13;\nfrom the fact that Cuba's socialist state has managed to endure for 55 years, there&#13;\nis little for Ra\u00fal to celebrate. Cuba's overall income and caloric consumption&#13;\nper capita today are not that much higher than they were in 1958. In 1958, Cuba&#13;\nwas <a href=\"http://www.ascecuba.org/publications/proceedings/volume19/pdfs/mesolago.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">at the top</a> among Latin&#13;\nAmerican nations in terms of the number&#13;\nof newspapers, TV stations, TV sets, telephones, and automobiles per capita;&#13;\ntoday, it is at the bottom.\u00a0 The&#13;\ngovernment claims that independence from Washington was a significant achievement,&#13;\nbut today the Revolution is <a href=\"http://www.havanatimes.org/?p=94444\" target=\"_blank\">embarrassingly dependent</a> on Miami, which&#13;\nin 2013 sent remittances amounting to $5.1 billion, enough to provide $1000 for&#13;\nevery Cuban worker in a country where the average annual salary is less than&#13;\n$260. &#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nCuba&#13;\nis a developmental anomaly. It has some of the highest numbers in average years of&#13;\nschooling in the world (as is typical&#13;\nin totalitarian states), but also has one of the lowest economic growth rates in&#13;\nthe world. It is hard to find a comparable case: typically, these higher averages go hand-in-hand with higher incomes. &#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nMany&#13;\nblame the U.S. embargo for Cuba's economic underperformance. But the embargo&#13;\nhas always been offset by the massive subsidies that the Soviet Union provided during&#13;\nthe Cold War and that the petro-state of Venezuela has <a href=\"http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=345051&amp;CategoryId=10717\" target=\"_blank\">provided</a> since 2001. And&#13;\nyet, despite these direct subsidies (and Cuba's newly burgeoning trade&#13;\nrelations with countries around the world), the state is still unable to produce&#13;\nanything efficiently. &#13;\n</p>&#13;\n<p>&#13;\nCuba's&#13;\nonly value-added export is the talent of its people, who have been emigrating&#13;\nin droves for the past 55 years despite the lack of civil strife since the mid-1960s.&#13;\nThis year, the government liberalized exit visas (though it did not lower the&#13;\ncost of passports), leading to a 35 percent increase in departures relative to&#13;\n2012.

There, he spent six days taking courses in computer hacking and programming at a local professional school, according to school officials and people familiar with Snowden's trip. Working with a private instructor, Snowden, who was then a contractor for the spy agency, took a course in \"ethical hacking,\" where he learned advanced techniques for breaking into computer systems and exploiting flaws in software. The class's ostensible purpose is to train students to protect computers and their contents from thieves and spies. But in order to do that, they learn how to break into computers and steal information. Snowden also inquired about methods to reverse-engineer the world's most popular kits for committing widespread online crime. Snowden didn't disclose his India trip to investigators when renewing his top-secret security clearance the following year. It was that clearance, NSA officials say, that gave Snowden access to the 1.7 million classified files he later stole from the agency's computer networks and databases. U.S. intelligence officials have faulted the company that conducted Snowden's background check for not more thoroughly questioning him about overseas travel and what foreign nationals he may have met with, which is standard procedure for detecting whether someone is spying for a foreign power. They have characterized the background check as flawed and incomplete. But Foreign Policy has learned that Snowden's trip to India should not have been a mystery to the U.S. government or intelligence agencies. Snowden was in the country in his capacity as an NSA contractor \"to assist as a technical expert\" at the U.S. embassy in New Delhi, according to an individual with knowledge of the situation who asked not to be identified. Snowden also told his computer instructor that he worked for the NSA and that he was in the city \"on business,\" said Rohit Aggarwal, the CEO and founder of the school, Koenig Solutions. Government employees and contractors are not required to disclose foreign trips of an official nature, and may even be instructed not to, in order to avoid compromising intelligence operations and programs, according to two former U.S. intelligence officials. Snowden's time in India has been covered in the Indian press but has received little attention in the United States. The travels offer a rare glimpse into his activities in the years before he became arguably the most famous leaker of classified secrets in American history. Precisely what work Snowden did at the embassy in New Delhi is unclear. At the time, he worked as a technology specialist for Dell Inc. at an NSA facility in Japan. U.S. intelligence personnel are often stationed in American embassies, so it's conceivable that Snowden could have been working on surveillance equipment in New Delhi. Among the documents that Snowden disclosed were those describing a program called Stateroom, which gathers electronic communications using equipment based in U.S. embassies around the world. Other documents Snowden released showed that the NSA may have spied on the Indian embassy in Washington and on the country's mission to the United Nations. Calls and emails to the U.S. embassy in New Delhi were not returned. Spokespersons for the NSA, the CIA, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence all declined to comment for this article. According to officials at the Koenig school, Snowden flew to India from Japan, arriving on Sept. 2, 2010, and staying for one night at New Delhi's Hyatt Regency hotel. A Koenig representative picked him up at the hotel on Sept. 3 and then drove Snowden to a lodging facility provided by the school. He stayed there until Sept. 9 while he took classes, and then returned for one more night at the Hyatt before leaving India on Sept. 11, the school said. (Indian news publications, citing official travel and immigration documents, also show that Snowden was in the country during this period.) Snowden's instructor said he made no secret about his work for the NSA. While he didn't describe the specific purpose of his visit, he did say he wanted to squeeze in some computer coursework while he was in town. The U.S. embassy is only six miles from the Koenig school. Snowden paid the $2,000 tuition and lodging fee himself, using a personal credit card, Aggarwal said. Snowden's instructor described him as quiet and diligent. He didn't take many breaks. And he already had a high-level of knowledge about computer science, hacking, and programming. Had background investigators inquired about Snowden's travels, they likely would have asked if he'd had any contact with foreign nationals while he was abroad. All security clearance holders are required to disclose significant contact with foreigners. But any instructors and students Snowden met probably wouldn't have risen to that level, a former intelligence official said. A Koenig spokesman said the school could only vouch for Snowden's whereabouts while he was taking courses during the day. \"Other than our people and students we would have no idea whom he met,\" said the spokesman, Somit Biswas. In addition to the ethical hacking course, Snowden took a class in the Java computer programming language. Snowden said the course \"would help him in 'organizing a team who does' work on Java\" at Dell, a Koenig spokesperson said, citing a questionnaire that Snowden was required to fill out before he came to the school. \"His stated goal for coming to train at Koenig ... was 'getting knowledge and evaluating Koenig's training program for my company. Certification might be nice, but it is not necessary,'\" Biswas said. \"He had also stated that his employers had approved Koenig as a training provider and that he would also be writing a review of the training experience which would help his company to evaluate Koenig as a future training partner and might be mutually beneficial to both.\" David Frink, a spokesperson for Dell, declined to comment. \"We have not discussed Mr. Snowden's role with Dell and don't plan to,\" he said. The Wall Street Journal reported last year that Snowden's \"work supervisor\" informed investigators performing his background check that he had gone to India, but that they failed to clarify the purpose of the trip, resulting in a report that \"did not present a comprehensive picture of Mr. Snowden,\" according to an intelligence documents. Biswas said Snowden also inquired about courses in the analysis and reverse engineering of malicious computer code, such as the the ZeuS, Fragus, and SpyEye crimeware kits. That was a curious request, and potentially at odds with his interest in ethical hacking. Understanding malware is important for defending against it. But these are not ordinary malware. ZeuS is the world's premier toolbox for custom-building online crime campaigns. It has been used to infect millions of computers around the world. All three programs have been used by criminals to commandeer individuals' computers and to steal financial information. SpyEye allows criminals to create fake bank web pages, in order to trick people into entering their login and password, which the criminal then steals and uses to enter, and empty, their accounts. Last year, Microsoft filed a civil complaint alleging that clusters of computers infected with ZeuS have been used to steal more than $100 million. It's not clear why Snowden wanted to know about reverse engineering financial crime malware, but his resume indicates he may have been working on cyber security-related projects while a contractor with Dell. Koenig told Snowden that it didn't offer courses along the lines he was interested in, but that it was considering adding them to its curriculum. Snowden abruptly ended his coursework before completing a final portion of his training, Aggarwal said, in computer hacking forensics and an administrator course in the Linux operating system. \"He was supposed to come back one morning, but he didn't. He sent an email saying, please cancel the rest of my courses. I have a medical condition and need to go back to Japan for medical advice,\" according to Aggarwal. Snowden spent the night of September 10 at the Hyatt Regency, and then left India the next day, he said. Snowden completed the ethical hacking course and the course in Java programming, Aggarwal said. A source who is familiar with Snowden's professional resume, which was current as of 2013, said it lists his certification in ethical hacking as well as computer network defense. The only reference to even remotely anything like Java, this person said, appears in relation to Snowden's work for a website company called Clockwork Chihuahua. There, Snowden said he edited JavaScript (which is loosely related to, but is not the same as Java). Snowden also claimed to have Japanese language skills and to be \"comfortable working in austere environments,\" according to his resume. U.S. officials have said that Snowden began downloading secret NSA files while he was working for Dell, in April 2012. He went to work for another NSA contractor, Booz Allen Hamilton, the following year. Snowden told the South China Morning Post that he took the job in order to access classified NSA documents. \"My position with Booz Allen Hamilton granted me access to lists of machines all over the world the NSA hacked,\" Snowden said. \"That is why I accepted that position about three months ago.\" Snowden worked for the company only a few months, at a facility in Hawaii. There, he took more documents before ultimately fleeing to Hong Kong. He is currently living in Russia, where the government has granted him temporary asylum. A computer security training professional in the United States said it's not unusual for Americans to take courses abroad, particularly in India, where the tuition is a fraction of what it can cost in the United States. But the expert criticized the teaching of so-called \"ethical hacking.\" \"They can call it 'ethical,' it's still hacking. You're teaching someone how to break into a system,\" the expert said. Aggarwal, the Koening CEO, said it's not unusual to find U.S. intelligence employees taking courses at his school, and that between 50 and 100 American military service personnel take courses there each year, as well as at a location in Dubai. A Defense Department spokesman could not confirm that military personnel have taken courses at the school, or that it's been approved by the Pentagon as a training facility. But personnel responsible for protecting the department's computer systems are required to obtain commercial certificaitons, including in ethical hacking.

Their position subsequently changed, but a group of Conservative MPs - some on the right of the party - believe that \"grudging support\" for the measure doesn't strike the right tone for a party which claims to be on the side of hard working families. Some are urging the prime minister to make a speech setting out why his party had been wrong not to introduce it themselves in order to \"kill off a negative\". They see parallels with David Cameron's backing for the NHS, another Labour creation, before the last election. The then opposition leader stated he could sum up his political priorities in three letters - N.H.S - and then attempted to steal a march on Labour by pledging to increase the health budget. Past errors These Conservative backbenchers want to see a similar approach to helping the low paid - a \"clear the way\" speech recognising past errors, followed by an above-inflation increase in minimum wage rates. And now more influential figures are making their voices heard. Sources close to the Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith suggest he is in favour of a significant increase - partly because, with the chancellor keen to make further welfare savings, the higher the minimum wage then the lower the expenditure on tax credits to top up low incomes. The business minister Matt Hancock - a former adviser to George Osborne - previously agreed to an increase in the lower apprentice rate, and is likely to favour an across the board increase now. Another minister close to the Chancellor, Sajid Javid, told the BBC on Wednesday that the minimum wage \"is about 10% lower in real terms, I think, than where it was in 2008\" and there was a \"a strong case to look at it\". And indeed it is already being examined. Review Last September, the business secretary Vince Cable asked the Low Pay Commission - which recommends minimum wage rates - to look at what economic conditions would be needed for a higher than usual rise. The Commission will report to him - and to David Cameron and Nick Clegg - by the end of next month. It is well known that Mr Cable wants to see the minimum wage rise as the economy recovers. However, sources close to the business secretary are making it clear that he has no intention of agreeing to a pre-election inflation-busting boost, unless specifically recommended by the experts, and not simply by fellow politicians. He is far more likely to accept whatever the Commission recommends and doesn't believe the Chancellor will try to over-rule him. That's not to say that the Conservatives couldn't pledge a much bigger increase in their next manifesto. Political ground But the Lib Dems see the current debate amongst their coalition partners as an attempt to move on to their ground, having alienated more moderate support over Europe and immigration, and aren't minded to help them out just yet. But some Conservatives say there is a way of appealing to those on low incomes without over-ruling the Low Pay Commission if it opts for a modest rise this year. These MPs are pressing the Treasury to look at the net - rather than gross pay - of those on the minimum wage. From April the first \u00a310,000 of income will be tax free but workers begin paying national insurance - which to many, feels like a tax - at the lower income of \u00a37,775. By raising the national insurance threshold to \u00a310,000 too by the time of the election the Conservatives would be able to say that all those on the minimum wage were better off. That of course would cost, not save, money. 'Top-up' But there are calls, too, for a minimum wage \"top up\" in areas of high costs and higher average earnings paid for by employers, not government. Labour politicians have also talked of backing a significant rise in the minimum wage, but without specific figures and having a higher \"minimum\" in some sectors of the economy. But their main thrust is likely to be on pressing companies to pay a higher \"living wage\" - currently \u00a37.65 an hour, rather than the minimum adult hourly rate of \u00a36.31. A future Labour government would be likely to insist that private employers which benefit from public sector contracts pay their employees this higher figure, or above. Some Conservative strategists believe Labour would be on the back foot if the current government backed a significant increase for the low-paid. For their part, Labour strategists believe the debate demonstrates that David Cameron is being forced to fight on their territory - that is, he's battling over the cost of living and not the improving state of the economy.", "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2014 21:57:32 GMT", "tags": null, "title": "Parties fight for low-paid", "updated": "Wed, 08 Jan 2014 21:57:32 GMT", "author": null, "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25656435#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa", "_id": 96145523, "html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"story-body\">\n    \t\t  <span class=\"story-date\">&#13;\n    <span class=\"date\">8 January 2014</span>&#13;\n<span class=\"time-text\">Last updated at </span><span class=\"time\">16:57 ET</span>&#13;\n\t  &#13;\n</span>&#13;\n&#13;\n\t&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n\t<h1 class=\"story-header\">Minimum wage set to become pre-election battleground</h1>&#13;\n&#13;\n     &#13;\n         &#13;\n \n    \n    \n\t\t\t\t\t            \t            \t    \t\t \t\t\t<span class=\"byline byline-photo\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/53892000/jpg/_53892814_004236027-1.jpg\" alt=\"Iain Watson\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"byline-name\">By Iain Watson</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class=\"byline-title\">Political correspondent, BBC News</span>\n\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\n        <div class=\"caption full-width\">&#13;\n  <img src=\"http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/72165000/jpg/_72165818_72165793.jpg\" alt=\"A cleaner sweeps the steps outside the venue of the 2013 Conservative conference\"/>&#13;\n&#13;\n  </div>&#13;\n\t&#13;\n                      <p class=\"introduction\" id=\"story_continues_1\">When the minimum wage was introduced by Labour in 1999, the Conservatives opposed it and suggested it could cost jobs.</p>&#13;\n        <p>Their position subsequently changed, but a group of Conservative MPs - some on the right of the party - believe that \"grudging support\" for the measure doesn't strike the right tone for a party which claims to be on the side of hard working  families.</p>&#13;\n        <p>Some are urging the prime minister to make a speech setting out why his party had been wrong not to introduce it themselves in order to \"kill off a negative\".</p>&#13;\n        <p>They see parallels with David Cameron's backing for the NHS, another Labour creation, before the last election.</p>&#13;\n        <p>The then opposition leader stated he could sum up his political priorities in three letters - N.H.S - and then attempted to steal a march on Labour by pledging to increase the health budget.</p>&#13;\n  <span class=\"cross-head\">Past errors</span>&#13;\n\t      <p>These Conservative backbenchers want to see a similar approach to helping the low paid - a \"clear the way\" speech recognising past errors, followed by an above-inflation increase in minimum wage rates.</p>&#13;\n        <p>And now more influential figures are making their voices heard.</p>&#13;\n        <p>Sources close to the Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith suggest he is in favour of a significant increase - partly because, with the chancellor keen to make further welfare savings, the higher the minimum wage then the lower the expenditure on tax credits to top up low incomes.</p>&#13;\n        <p>The business minister Matt Hancock - a former adviser to George Osborne - previously agreed to an increase in the lower apprentice rate, and is likely to favour an across the board increase now. </p>&#13;\n        <p>Another minister close to the Chancellor, Sajid Javid, told the BBC on Wednesday that the minimum wage \"is about 10% lower in real terms, I think, than where it was in 2008\" and there was a \"a strong case to look at it\".</p>&#13;\n        <p>And indeed it is already being examined.</p>&#13;\n  <span class=\"cross-head\">Review</span>&#13;\n\t      <p>Last September, the business secretary Vince Cable asked the Low Pay Commission - which recommends minimum wage rates - to look at what economic conditions would be needed for a higher than usual rise.</p>&#13;\n        <p>The Commission will report to him - and to David Cameron and Nick Clegg - by the end of next month.</p>&#13;\n        <p>It is well known that Mr Cable wants to see the minimum wage rise as the economy recovers. </p>&#13;\n        <p>However, sources close to the business secretary are making it clear that he has no intention of agreeing to a pre-election inflation-busting boost, unless specifically recommended by the experts, and not simply by fellow politicians.</p>&#13;\n        <p>He is far more likely to accept whatever the Commission recommends and doesn't believe the Chancellor will try to over-rule him.</p>&#13;\n        <p>That's not to say that the Conservatives couldn't pledge a much bigger increase in their next manifesto. </p>&#13;\n  <span class=\"cross-head\">Political ground</span>&#13;\n\t      <p>But the Lib Dems see the current debate amongst their coalition partners as an attempt to move on to their ground, having alienated more moderate support over Europe and immigration, and aren't minded to help them out just yet.</p>&#13;\n        <p>But some Conservatives say there is a way of appealing to those on low incomes without over-ruling the Low Pay Commission if it opts for a modest rise this year. </p>&#13;\n        <p>These MPs are pressing the Treasury to look at the net - rather than gross pay - of those on the minimum wage.</p>&#13;\n        <p>From April the first \u00a310,000 of income will be tax free but workers begin paying national insurance  - which to many, feels like a tax - at the lower income of \u00a37,775.</p>&#13;\n        <p>By raising the national insurance threshold to \u00a310,000 too by the time of the election the Conservatives would be able to say that all those on the minimum wage were better off. That of course would cost, not save, money.</p>&#13;\n  <span class=\"cross-head\">'Top-up'</span>&#13;\n\t      <p>But there are calls, too, for a minimum wage \"top up\" in areas of high costs and higher average earnings paid for by employers, not government.</p>&#13;\n        <p>Labour politicians have also talked of backing a significant rise in the minimum wage, but without specific figures and having a higher \"minimum\" in some sectors of the economy.</p>&#13;\n        <p>But their main thrust is likely to be on pressing companies to pay a higher \"living wage\" - currently \u00a37.65 an hour, rather than the minimum adult hourly rate of \u00a36.31. </p>&#13;\n        <p>A future Labour government would be likely to insist that private employers which benefit from public sector contracts pay their employees this higher figure, or above. </p>&#13;\n        <p>Some Conservative strategists believe Labour would be on the back foot if the current government backed a significant increase for the low-paid.</p>&#13;\n        <p>For their part, Labour strategists believe the debate demonstrates that David Cameron is being forced to fight on their territory - that is, he's battling over the cost of living and not the improving state of the economy.</p>&#13;\n  \n\n\t</div>\n  \n  </div></body></html>"}, {"source": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/AtlanticPoliticsChannel", "text": "Governor Chris Christie is embarrassed and humiliated by his administration's George Washington Bridge scandal.

Diplomatic tensions between China and Japan showed no signs of abating this past week as the two countries traded barbs over Africa. On Thursday, Lu Shaye, head of the Chinese Foreign Ministry\u2019s African affairs department, defended China\u2019s engagement in the continent. China is \u201csincere,\u201d Mr. Lu said, \u201cunlike some countries\u201d that he said are driven by self-interest and politics. His comments followed remarks by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, during a visit to Mozambique this month, that Japan will not just extract resources from Africa but \u201ccreate jobs.\u201d Tomohiko Taniguchi, Mr. Abe\u2019s spokesman, told the BBC that countries like Japan \u201ccannot provide African leaders with beautiful houses or beautiful ministerial buildings.\u201d Instead, Japan\u2019s policy is \u201cto really aid the human capital of Africa.\u201d Mr. Abe was trying to distinguish Japan\u2019s efforts from those of China, Europe and the United States, news agencies reported. However, at a time of tension between Japan and China, the Chinese Foreign Ministry responded angrily, calling Mr. Abe\u2019s comments \u201cunprofessional and ridiculous.\u201d Relations between the two countries have been strained because of a sovereignty dispute over several East China Sea islands and unresolved issues from Japan\u2019s wartime past. Mr. Abe\u2019s decision in December to visit the Yasukuni Shrine, where convicted war criminals are honored along with other Japanese war dead, drew angry condemnation from China and South Korea. In an online interview with the state news agency Xinhua on Thursday, Mr. Lu said that African countries \u201chave already seen\u201d that Japan was eyeing African resources and markets, wanting to compete with China and to win votes at the United Nations. He criticized Japan\u2019s approach as empty words whereas Chinese assistance \u201ccan be seen and touched.\u201d China has financed the construction of numerous major infrastructure projects in Africa, including government buildings, roads and railways \u2013 often with resource-backed loans. \u201cDuring Abe\u2019s visit to Africa, the Japanese side said China only engages in infrastructure construction,\u201d Mr. Lu said. \u201cThe problem is, without infrastructure, how can Africa develop? Why don\u2019t you, Japan, help Africa with basic infrastructure?\u201d In the days after Mr. Abe\u2019s visit to the Yasukuni Shrine, the Chinese government waged a global diplomatic campaign denouncing Mr. Abe\u2019s actions, which Beijing sees as disregarding Japan\u2019s wartime past. Shortly after Mr. Abe wrapped up his Africa tour, which included visits to Ivory Coast and Ethiopia and pledges of hundreds of millions of dollars in aid, the Chinese ambassador to Ethiopia, Xie Xiaoyan, held a news conference at which he accused the Japanese leader of being \u201cthe biggest troublemaker in Asia,\u201d Xinhua reported. Holding up several graphic photos that he said showed victims of Japanese atrocities during World War II, Mr. Xie said he wanted to inform Africans about Japan\u2019s record in Asia, the article said. Mr. Xie is one of more than a dozen Chinese ambassadors around the world who have expounded on Beijing\u2019s views in local newspapers and television since Mr. Abe\u2019s visit to the Yasukuni Shrine on Dec. 26. Cui Tiankai, the Chinese ambassador to the United States and a former ambassador to Japan, wrote an op-ed piece for The Washington Post this month that called the shrine \u201cground zero for the unrepentant view of Japan\u2019s wartime aggression.\u201d Mr. Abe\u2019s visit, he said, was a challenge to the world. On Friday, The Washington Post carried an op-ed by the Japanese ambassador in the United States, Kenichiro Sasae, who called on China to \u201ccease its dogmatic anti-Japanese propaganda campaign and work with us toward a future-oriented relationship.\u201d The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, said on Thursday that the Chinese diplomats\u2019 actions in recent days were aimed at ensuring that countries around the world \u201cclearly recognize the threat to world peace Mr. Abe\u2019s visit to Yasukuni poses.\u201d Beijing\u2019s recent diplomatic push in part reflects the government\u2019s increasing appreciation of public outreach. In recent years, China has stepped up its public diplomacy \u2013 from trying to project a better image of Chinese development projects in Myanmar to setting up a Foreign Ministry-affiliated Public Diplomacy Association, led by retired senior diplomats. Global Times, a nationalist-leaning state-run newspaper, published an editorial last week that argued that the war of words was an important fight that China \u201cmust not lose.\u201d \u201cThere is no smoke in this \u2018Chinese-Japanese public opinion war\u2019 but it is a special 21st century battlefield,\u201d the paper said.", "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2014 10:57:09 GMT", "tags": ["Global Times", "Ivory Coast", "Diplomatic Service, Embassies and Consulates", "East China Sea", "Cui Tiankai", "Japan", "Abe, Shinzo", "China", "Ethiopia", "Myanmar", "Washington Post", "Mozambique", "Xinhua", "World War II (1939-45)", "British Broadcasting Corp"], "title": "Sinosphere Blog: Between China and Japan, a Tug-of-War Over Africa", "updated": "Fri, 17 Jan 2014 10:57:09 GMT", "author": "By BREE FENG", "url": "http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/17/between-china-and-japan-a-tug-of-war-over-africa/?partner=rss&emc=rss", "_id": 105913736, "html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content\"><div class=\"w592\"><img src=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/01/17/world/16sino-africa01/16sino-africa01-tmagArticle.jpg\" id=\"100000002656061\" alt=\"Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan sits between Ethiopia's prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, right, and the deputy chairman of the African Union Commission, Erastus Mwencha, during a visit to the African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on Jan. 14.\"/><span class=\"credit\">Elias Asmare/Associated Press</span> <span class=\"caption\">Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan sits between Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, right, and the deputy chairman of the African Union Commission, Erastus Mwencha, during a visit to the African Union headquarters in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on Jan. 14.</span></div>\n\n<p class=\"story-body-text\"><br/>\nDiplomatic tensions between China and Japan showed no signs of abating this past week as the two countries traded barbs over Africa.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">On Thursday, Lu Shaye, head of the Chinese Foreign Ministry\u2019s African affairs department, defended China\u2019s engagement in the continent.

Mosab al-Jamal stands beside a Free Syrian University sign in Reyhanli, Turkey, near the Syrian border. (Daniel Seckman and Matt Trevithick)REYHANLI, Turkey \u2014 Mosab al-Jamal sees his family once a week, and sleeps only four hours a night. As he lights his fifth cigarette in almost as many minutes, he stops talking and looks out the window onto a dusty, quiet street, beyond which lies Syria. \u201cSo many students, so many educations interrupted,\u201d he murmurs quietly. A former law professor at Damascus University and a portly man in his late fifties, al-Jamal is the leader of a group of academics who have created the Free Syrian University, an academic institution that began teaching classes in November in the once-sleepy Turkish town of Reyhanli, only a few miles from the Syrian border. \u201cThis is only temporary,\u201d he says, arms swinging as he surveys his surroundings in his office on the top floor of a modest apartment building. A Free Syrian Army flag lies folded in the corner of the room, and an elaborate but weathered sign works hard to bestow legitimacy to his operation, saying simply, \u201cLegal Authority of Syrian Revolution.\u201d Worn furniture, scattered ashtrays, and empty demitasses round out the rest of the room. The effort to get the school off the ground comes as the Syrian conflict, which has left more than 130,000 dead and produced more than 2 million refugees, enters its 34th month. Amid the horrific day-to-day death and destruction, several concerned academics are taking the long view\u2014realizing that regardless of the outcome of the war, Syria, whose society has long respected those with advanced degrees and whose state-run educational institutions were once points of pride, stands to lose the minds of an entire generation of educated youth. It is these young people who will be essential for the country\u2019s rehabilitation after the last bullet is fired. Until then, ongoing conflict has ended almost all educational opportunities for Syrian youth, many of whom struggle in nearby countries to advance their educations against linguistic, cultural, and economic barriers. \u201cWe university professors have an enormous responsibility to face this reality. Ours is an academic duty to answer this educational crisis.\u201dIsmail is one of them, eager to build on his education in neighboring Turkey but thus far unable to enroll in classes. The 22-year-old was a law student at Damascus University before Syria\u2019s civil war erupted and attended the peaceful protests in 2011. \u201cI was scared, but I was kind of optimistic too. The regime was there filming us, but, amazingly, nothing happened. I think this encouraged us. We were all dancing in the street,\u201d he recalls, eagerly showing videos taken on his iPhone that have received thousands of hits on YouTube. \u201cThen, within a month or two, they started shooting at us. What [was] I supposed to do? They started shelling areas full of the youth, killing children.\u201d Ismail, who asked that his last name not be used, left Syria in early 2012 and arrived in Turkey via Aleppo as the fighting worsened. Now delivering water for a Turkish company in Gaziantep, a city 40 minutes from the Syrian border, Ismail embodies the challenges facing displaced Syrian students hoping to continue their educations. \u201cI have almost no options,\u201d he explains. \u201cFirst, I have to take Turkish-language classes for nine months, and have to start university all over again, and that\u2019s only if I have the proper paperwork. But the FSA [Free Syrian Army] doesn\u2019t give out passports and the regime makes you collect your passport in person, so I have no paperwork. Second, there\u2019s lots of confusing information about scholarships\u2014the Turkish government has announced them publicly, but when I ask about them, I am told they don\u2019t exist. And the fees for university here are high for Syrians, the Syrian pound is worthless now.\u201d Asked if he could continue his studies at Damascus University, which is still holding classes and contributing to the veneer of normalcy that the Assad regime has sought to promote, Ismail is dismissive. \u201cThere is no more education in Syria,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s all for show, whatever is left.\u201d \u201cWe university professors have an enormous responsibility to face this reality,\u201d says al-Jamal. \u201cOurs is an academic duty to answer this educational crisis.\u201d Ibrahimi al-Haji, a prominent jurist in Aleppo before the civil war, now advises the Free Syrian University on legal matters. (Daniel Seckman and Matt Trevithick)The idea for the Free Syrian University took root one year ago among several former classmates who attended Damascus University with al-Jamal in the 1970s and fled Syria for Turkey at the outbreak of violence. These include Ibrahimi al-Haji, who for 18 years was the chief justice in a court in Aleppo, Syria\u2019s largest city, and who now functions as the university\u2019s legal advisor. Support has also come from professors among the Syrian diaspora living in Europe, who have offered to teach classes both in Turkey and from afar via the Internet, primarily through Facebook and Skype. The curriculum, al-Jamal says, is \u201ca combination of the old regime curriculum and new information from Sweden and Germany in particular. For example, we are adding English to each student\u2019s courses each semester, so that all of our graduates can easily find work.\u201d University officials are offering students 13 majors, including political science, law, media, education, psychology, economics, business, Arabic literature, and pharmacology. Perhaps with a nod to the university\u2019s location, the institution will also offer degrees in Turkish and English translation. \u201cWe have 32 professors ready here in Reyhanli and more than 60 around the world who are helping,\u201d says a young female lawyer from Damascus who is working at the university and who asked to remain anonymous because her family is still in Syria. \u201cAll are Syrian.\u201d \u201cThere is no more education in Syria,\u201d Ismail says. \u201cIt\u2019s all for show, whatever is left.\u201d For young Syrian refugees like Ismail who are in Turkey, classes are taught in a three-story office building in Reyhanli. But al-Jamal is intent on also providing educational opportunities to students trapped or displaced inside Syria. To that end, through what he terms an \u201copen-learning\u201d approach, the Syrian academic is making heavy use of the Internet, including social networks like Facebook, to deliver lessons to students still in Syria. Syrian professors in Turkey and around the world are working to record lessons relevant to the set curriculum and post them online. University staff then distribute these lessons to a growing mailing list divided by major. \u201cThis is temporary, to immediately address this reality,\u201d al-Jamal says. The school sends most of its news out via its Facebook page, which more than 6,000 people follow. The Free Syrian University has formally enrolled 870 students in Turkey and has hundreds more on digital mailing lists inside Syria and other neighboring countries, mainly in Jordan. \u201cThe enrollment looks great,\u201d al-Jamal says. He estimates that enrollment could reach as high as 11,500 in just a few years if the conflict continues, mainly because there are so few options for Syrians seeking an advanced degree, and because students may eventually come from Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon to study. A modest fee structure is in place, though more than 90 percent of students are unable to pay anything and attend classes for free. \u201cWe charge $280 per semester to those students inside Syria, and $560 per semester to those students outside,\u201d says al-Jamal. \u201cWe would prefer to charge nothing, but supplies are expensive and our teaching staff have families who need their support. This income just covers our costs.\u201d The university will admit any Syrian who was a student prior to the fighting as well as those who would have been scheduled to attend college. Al-Jamal repeatedly stresses that no one has supported the venture financially, and that all costs are paid out of pocket, many by the university professors themselves. \u201cWe give new professors $1,500 when they sign up. Total. That\u2019s all we can give them,\u201d he notes, adding that he hopes others will see the importance of supporting Syria\u2019s future leaders. The university\u2019s stated goal is \u201cto prepare educated generations who seek to build a country of law and justice and institutions.\u201d Mosab al-Jamal at his office in Reyhanli. (Daniel Seckman and Matt Trevithick)Though there is no outright political agenda in classrooms and operations are largely funded by professors themselves, the university\u2014with both its name and its mandate from the Free Syrian Legal Authority, a type of clearinghouse organization that proves the organization functions with the blessing of the Free Syrian Army\u2014is directly connected to the armed resistance against the Assad regime. Depending on the outcome of the war, this could prove problematic for graduates as well as university officials should they seek accreditation or re-enter Syria. When we interviewed al-Jamal, this connection was personified by a quiet, chain-smoking man in a leather jacket who was introduced only as \u201cthe colonel\u201d and who was never out of earshot during our conversation. He interrupted only when talk turned to the nature of the conflict in Syria. \u201cThis is a revolution, nothing else,\u201d he said sharply when the wrong vernacular was used. He is certain the Assad regime will fall \u201cany day now.\u201d For now, the Free Syrian University\u2019s bespectacled academics know there is no going back to Syria. \u201cI burned my life in Syria when I left,\u201d says al-Jamal, eliciting nods of agreement from Syrian academics around him. \u201cIt was the suppression of the educated. It was the suppression of the arts. And the suppression of all those outside of the regime over the last decades\u2014that is our reason for being a part of this.\u201d \u201cWe have these new ideas,\u201d he adds. \u201cThat is why we started this.\u201d", "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2014 21:56:49 GMT", "tags": ["International"], "title": "The Scholar-Rebels of the Free Syrian University", "updated": "Fri, 17 Jan 2014 21:56:49 GMT", "author": "Daniel Seckman and Matt Trevithick", "url": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticInternational/~3/0VanOLEvhbU/story01.htm", "_id": 106829908, "html": "<html><body><div><p class=\"dek\">\n            Piecing together a college in exile with Skype, Facebook, and some office space in Turkey.        </p>\n    \n    <div class=\"article-content\">\n\n                \n                \n        <figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/01/FSUPres/f33fdf1e3.jpg\"/><figcaption class=\"caption\">Mosab al-Jamal stands beside a Free Syrian University sign in Reyhanli, Turkey, near the Syrian border.

SMITH and EMMA G. FITZSIMMONSJAN. 25, 2014 Play Video Video|0:43 Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Three Killed in Maryland Mall Shooting A shooting at The Mall in Columbia in suburban Maryland left three dead including the suspected assailant. COLUMBIA, Md. \u2014 Shots rang out at a popular shopping mall in this suburb between Washington and Baltimore on Saturday morning, sending shoppers running from stores and hiding under tables in the food court. When police officers arrived, they found three people dead inside a skate shop on the upper level of the two-story center, the Mall in Columbia. Two of the victims were a young man and woman who worked at the store. The body of another man, who is suspected of being the attacker, was found near the victims with a shotgun and ammunition nearby, police officials said. The man is believed to have committed suicide, they said. Related Coverage Five other people had minor injuries \u2014 most of them suffered as they fled after hearing the gunshots \u2014 and were released from a hospital on Saturday evening after receiving treatment. The shootings at the Mall in Columbia set off fears in the area as residents waited to hear from loved ones and concern across the country over thoughts of yet another mass killing. But at a news conference held about two hours after the initial gunshots, the county police chief, William J. McMahon, said he believed the shootings were an isolated episode involving just the three people who were found dead. \u201cTo our knowledge, all the activity took place at one time, in one store,\u201d Chief McMahon said.He said that only one weapon was found at the scene \u2014 a shotgun \u2014 and that police officers had not fired any shots. The police said they had tentatively identified the suspect, but they declined to release his name while they followed up on leads. They did say he had a large amount of ammunition, including a bag that contained two \u201ccrude devices that appeared to be an attempt at making explosives using fireworks.\u201d Those devices were disabled, the police said.The two employees who were killed were identified by Saturday evening as Brianna Benlolo, 21, of College Park, Md., and Tyler Johnson, 25, of Ellicott City, Md. On her Facebook profile, Ms. Benlolo said that she was the first assistant manager at the store and had worked there since November 2012. She was from Cocoa Beach, Fla., and had attended a Paul Mitchell hair school in Rockville, Md., according to her profile. Mr. Johnson\u2019s Facebook profile said he started working at Zumiez in November 2013. The Howard County 911 center received reports of shots fired at the mall around 11:15 a.m. The victims were found on the upper level at a store called Zumiez, which carries clothing and accessories for skateboarding and snowboarding. At the news conference, the Howard County executive, Ken Ulman, said it had been a \u201ctremendously trying few hours.\u201dHe added, \u201cWe want to send our thoughts and prayers to the family members of the victims.\u201dChief McMahon said that uniformed patrol officers were the first to arrive on the scene. They were joined a short time later by SWAT team members who began sweeping the mall looking for other potential gunmen and helping shoppers who were hiding inside stores. The authorities had asked people to stay there until they were sure it was safe to leave. The police said that they believed the suspect had died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound and had acted alone. Chief McMahon said his officers had not determined a motive for the attack. Chief William J. McMahon of the Howard County Police Department briefed reporters about the shooting at a mall in Columbia, Md. Jonathan Hanson for The New York Times The five people who were injured at the mall were taken to Howard County General Hospital. One person had a gunshot wound to the foot, and the four others were treated for a medical condition or minor injuries, like a twisted ankle. On Saturday evening, the hospital said that the five patients had been treated there and released. The owner of Zumiez released a statement on Saturday evening saying that the company was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by the violence at the store. The company said it planned to make counseling available to store employees in the area.\u201cThe Zumiez team is a tight-knit community and all of our hearts go out to Brianna and Tyler\u2019s families,\u201d Richard Brooks, the company\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement.On Saturday afternoon, the police responded to news media reports that the shootings were related to a domestic dispute, saying the authorities had not confirmed that. They said they had no information about whether the suspected gunman knew the victims.\u201cMotive of shooting is unknown. Not determined to be domestic or any other cause at this time. Any other reports are complete speculation,\u201d the Police Department said Saturday afternoon via Twitter.By 4 p.m., the police had cleared the mall of all shoppers and employees as investigators examined the crime scene.The mall had opened around 10 a.m. and was busy on the chilly day. It is a huge complex with almost 200 shops, including the anchor stores Macy\u2019s and Sears, and a movie theater. Henry Callahan, 19, was sitting at a table in the food court when he heard \u201cwhat sounded like a trash can being thrown over the balcony.\u201d He heard someone shout that a man had a gun and more screaming from upstairs.He hid under the table with a family that had a young child. He heard about nine shots fired, he said.\u201cI was legitimately frightened,\u201d Mr. Callahan said. \u201cI had no idea what was going on.\u201d Shoppers leave the scene. Jewel Samad/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images \u201cThe panic on their faces was tremendous,\u201d he said of the family he was hiding with.Mr. Callahan and the family hopped over the counter at an Arby\u2019s restaurant and escaped through a security door in the back hallway, he said.Law enforcement officials arrived in less than two minutes, Chief McMahon said. Around 12:20 p.m., just over an hour after it had begun, the Police Department posted on Twitter that the episode appeared to be over and that no additional shots had been heard.The department continued to post frequent updates to Twitter throughout the afternoon. Outside the mall, there was a swarm of emergency vehicles. Helicopters hovered as heavily armed officers stood watch.Chief McMahon noted that the police had practiced an emergency drill at the mall, which he said had helped them in their response to the shooting. The mall was built in 1971 in Columbia, Md., a planned community about 25 miles from Washington and about 15 miles from Baltimore. The town has about 97,000 residents spread over 10 separate villages. Along with the nearby Ellicott City, it was named by Money magazine in 2010 as one of the best places to live in America. Debbie Sergi was working at the Wockenfuss Candies store when she heard about five or six shots ring out that \u201csounded like a transformer had blown up.\u201d\u201cPeople started running, so we got our gates closed and got our customers hidden in the back room,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were lucky to get our doors closed and locked. We all cried. We were all scared. Really scared.\u201dWeis Karzai, 22, of Silver Spring, said he was walking into the mall with his younger brother when people suddenly began streaming out. \u201cPeople were running out, saying, \u2018Don\u2019t go in there. There\u2019s a guy with a gun,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cI grabbed my brother and just ran out and went back to the car.\u201d Just as he got into the car, he said, police and ambulances arrived on the scene.The mall will remain closed on Sunday, but the police said officers would patrol outside it throughout the night and guard the crime scene.

She was from Cocoa Beach, Fla., and had attended a Paul Mitchell hair school in Rockville, Md., according to her profile. Mr. Johnson\u2019s Facebook profile said he started working at Zumiez in November 2013. </p><p id=\"Moses\" class=\"ad moses-ad\"/><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"234\" data-total-count=\"2542\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The Howard County 911 center received reports of shots fired at the mall around 11:15 a.m. The victims were found on the upper level at a store called Zumiez, which carries clothing and accessories for skateboarding and snowboarding. </p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"119\" data-total-count=\"2661\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">At the news conference, the Howard County executive, Ken Ulman, said it had been a \u201ctremendously trying few hours.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"94\" data-total-count=\"2755\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">He added, \u201cWe want to send our thoughts and prayers to the family members of the victims.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"351\" data-total-count=\"3106\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Chief McMahon said that uniformed patrol officers were the first to arrive on the scene.

The former teacher expressed regret for her actions during the recorded conversation, which has gone viral online. In a YouTube video posted last Friday, Jamie Carrillo, the woman who identifies herself as the victim, calls Alhambra High School outside of Los Angeles and asks to speak to the vice principal, Andrea M. Cardosa. During the conversation, Ms. Cardosa confirms that she taught in Riverside, Calif., and acknowledges Ms. Carrillo as her former student. Ms. Carrillo begins the conversation nervously by asking what steps Ms. Cardosa, now a vice principal, takes when a student reports a sexual relationship with a teacher. The vice principal responds that she involves law enforcement officials. Then Ms. Carrillo asks the vice principal why she is above the law. \u201cWhy did you do that? I was only 12 years old when I met you,\u201d Ms. Carrillo says in the recording. \u201cDid you realize that you had brainwashed me, manipulated me? \u201cYes,\u201d the vice principal responds, \u201cAnd I regret it.\u201d Ms. Cardosa, who abruptly resigned from her position as vice principal on Friday after school and police officials learned of the video, could not be reached for comment. David M. Ring, a lawyer who has been representing Ms. Carrillo since the YouTube video attracted widespread media attention on Monday, said that his client was 12 in 1999 and a student at Chemawa Middle School in Riverside when she met Ms. Cordosa, then a teacher and basketball coach. \u201cWhat prompted her to do it is that she has kids of her own,\u201d Mr. Ring said of Ms. Carrillo. \u201cHer oldest is 11 years old. Over the last several months, it bothered her that she was about the same age when this lady did this to her. It got her angry. \u201d Mr. Ring said that Ms. Carrillo had \u201czero expectations\u201d that anything would come from posting her confrontation with her former teacher online. He said she searched on Google on Friday for the woman\u2019s name and was surprised to find someone by that name who was a vice principal at Alhambra High School. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t positive it was the same lady,\u201d Mr. Ring said. \u201cBut she made the important decision to call up the high school and see if it was the same lady and confront her.\u201d Later that day, the video came to the attention of Alhambra school district officials, who notified the police in Alhambra and Riverside, where law enforcement officials are looking into the accusations. School officials in Riverside declined to comment on the case, saying they were going by hand through school attendance and personnel records from that time period. Alhambra school district officials said that they would be issuing a statement later Tuesday. On Monday, Ms. Carrillo told a reporter from KTLA 5 in Los Angeles that she searched for her former teacher in Google on Friday after seeing another victim of sexual abuse recount her experience on television. She said that Ms. Cordosa first approached her in the locker room after a basketball practice and that the abuse continued for several years after she left middle school. In the YouTube video, Ms. Carrillo tells Ms. Cardosa that \u201cI am completely messed up and have so many issues because of you.\u201d \u201cI just wanted to help you,\u201d the woman who is identified as Ms. Cardosa replies. \u201cHow is having a sexual relationship with a 12-year-old student helping?\u201d Ms. Carrillo asks. The woman mumbles an answer and then says, \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d Since the YouTube video was posted, Mr. Ring said, Ms. Carrillo has heard from at least one other woman who said the teacher had made sexual advances toward her.", "published": "Tue, 21 Jan 2014 23:16:49 GMT", "tags": ["YouTube.com", "News", "Sex Crimes", "Video Recordings and Downloads", "U.S.", "Riverside (Calif)"], "title": "The Lede: Woman Posts Video of Phone Confrontation Accusing Ex-Teacher of Sexual Abuse", "updated": "Tue, 21 Jan 2014 23:16:49 GMT", "author": "By JENNIFER PRESTON", "url": "http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/21/woman-posts-video-of-phone-confrontation-accusing-ex-teacher-of-sexual-abuse/?partner=rss&emc=rss", "_id": 119219575, "html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content\"><div class=\"w480 videoContainer\">\n<div class=\"youtubeVideo\" data-youtube-id=\"_Vv7q-MLTyQ\" data-start=\"\">\n<div class=\"thumb\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/_Vv7q-MLTyQ/0.jpg\" alt=\"\"/>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n<p class=\"caption\">Video of a woman confronting a former teacher she said sexually abused her </p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"story-body-text\"/>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">A 28-year-old California woman <a href=\"http://youtu.be/_Vv7q-MLTyQ\">posted on YouTube</a> last week a secret telephone recording of her confrontation with a former middle school teacher who acknowledged sexually abusing her as a 12-year-old.

Over the last several months, it bothered her that she was about the same age when this lady did this to her.  It got her angry. \u201d </p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Mr. Ring said that Ms. Carrillo had \u201czero expectations\u201d that anything would come from posting her confrontation with her former teacher online. He said she searched on Google on Friday for the woman\u2019s name and was surprised to find someone by that name who was a vice principal at Alhambra High School.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">\u201cShe wasn\u2019t positive it was the same lady,\u201d Mr. Ring said. \u201cBut she made the important decision to call up the high school and see if it was the same lady and confront her.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Later that day, the video came to the attention of Alhambra school district officials, who notified the police in Alhambra and Riverside, where law enforcement officials are looking into the accusations. School officials in Riverside declined to  comment on the case, saying they were going by hand through school attendance and personnel records from that time period. </p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Alhambra school district officials said that they would be issuing a statement later Tuesday. </p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">On Monday, Ms. Carrillo <a href=\"http://ktla.com/2014/01/20/woman-posts-video-on-youtube-confronting-teacher-she-says-molested-her/\">told a reporter from KTLA 5 </a>in Los Angeles that she searched for her former teacher in Google on Friday after seeing another victim of sexual abuse recount her experience on television. She said that Ms. Cordosa first approached her in the locker room after a basketball practice and that the abuse continued for several years after she left middle school.</p>\n<p id=\"ndn_single_player_c28adef3-a2e1-d0bf-3769-a58aa095a417\"/>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">In the YouTube video, Ms. Carrillo tells Ms. Cardosa that \u201cI am completely messed up and have so many issues because of you.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">\u201cI just wanted to help you,\u201d the woman who is identified as Ms. Cardosa replies.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">\u201cHow is having a sexual relationship with a 12-year-old student helping?\u201d Ms. Carrillo asks.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">The woman mumbles an answer and then says, \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Since the YouTube video was posted, Mr. Ring said, Ms. Carrillo has heard from at least one other woman who said the teacher had made sexual advances toward her. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div></body></html>"}, {"source": "http://feeds.theguardian.com/theguardian/us/rss", "text": "US president Barack Obama will announce that the National Security Agency should no longer store US telephone data in bulk, in a significant change to the most controversial surveillance activity exposed by the Guardian thanks to whistleblower Edward Snowden. In a speech Friday morning at the Justice Department, Obama will call for an as-yet unspecified private entity to hold data on telephone calls made in the United States. He will also say that the NSA or the FBI must receive a judicial approval from a secret surveillance court before it can search through the data trove. Details of how the program will operate in the future were unclear hours before the widely anticipated speech. A senior administration official indicated that transitioning the metadata collection will take some time. Privacy advocates have been bracing themselves during the past week for Obama to call for merely cosmetic changes to a surveillance effort they regard as a disaster for civil liberties. A senior administration official portrayed the shift as an overhaul to mass surveillance that would better respect civil liberties, rather than an outright end to a practice the government has claimed is a critical counter-terrorism tool. This contention has been resisted by a federal judge, knowledgeable senators and Obama\u2019s own surveillance advisory group. \u201cThe president believes that the 215 program addresses important capabilities that allow us to counter-terrorism, but that we can and should be able to preserve those capabilities while addressing the privacy and civil liberties concerns that are raised by the government holding this metadata,\u201d the official said Friday, using a bureaucratic shorthand for the bulk collection of phone data. But \u201ceffective immediately\u201d, the NSA will need to obtain a finding from the secret surveillance panel known as the Fisa court in order to search its phone records database, a judicial check that has never existed since a version of the bulk phone data collection began in October 2001. Currently the NSA receives a 90-day order from the Fisa court to gather all domestic call records and to trawl the database when it has \u201creasonable articulable suspicion\u201d of a number\u2019s connection to a specified terrorist group. That order was likened to a general warrant by a federal judge in December, adding significant pressure on Obama and the NSA to overhaul the program. Before the next Fisa court application, scheduled for 28 March, the official said Obama would ask attorney general Eric Holder and the intelligence agencies for a report on \u201chow we can preserve the necessary capabilities of the program, without the government holding the metadata.\u201d That suggested Obama had not resolved the contours of any post-NSA metadata collection, despite a voluminous December report from a surveillance advisory group he empanelled in August and two weeks of consultations with the intelligence community, civil libertarians in and outside government, and congressional leaders. The official said the administration would continue to consult with the \u201crelevant committees\u201d in Congress \u201cto seek their views\u201d. Those contours have been in furious contention for weeks \u2013 a contest that is likely to continue well after Obama\u2019s speech. Privacy advocates, in and outside of Congress, have said the government should only be able to view metadata pursuant to a judge\u2019s order in all but emergency cases at a higher standard than \u201creasonable articulable suspicion\u201d in order to ensure that innocents are not swept up in data troves. They also want to ensure that the government will not require telephone companies to store customer data any longer than they currently do, which varies by firm but has an average maximum of 18 months. Compelling the companies to retain additional data \u201cwould not solve the problem, it would just outsource it\u201d, said Liza Goitien of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. The telephone companies have balked at storing additional data on the government\u2019s behalf, out of fear of exposing themselves to legal and financial liability. The NSA has argued that it needs the entire \u201chaystack\u201d of records showing phone calls made in the US for at least three and as many as five years, lest it be unable to detect patterns in call data that might indicate a domestic connection to terrorism. But the utility of the program for preventing terrorist attacks has been repeatedly disputed. The surveillance advisory group found it was \u201cnot essential\u201d for stopping terrorist attacks, but Michael Morrell, a panel member and former deputy CIA director, told Congress Tuesday that \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not important going forward\u201d, likening it to fire insurance. The dispute over the necessity for the bulk metadata collection will continue in Congress over the weeks and months ahead. Advocates of ending it are pushing a bipartisan bill known as the USA Freedom Act, which has yet to pass any of the four congressional committees in the House and Senate currently considering it. A competing Senate bill, sponsored by intelligence committee chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, would reaffirm and entrench the NSA\u2019s storage of bulk metadata; it has passed her committee. Obama has yet to endorse any of the competing bills, and early indications were that his Friday speech would leave significant room for Congress to recast the boundaries of surveillance. But civil liberties groups said Thursday that any lasting changes to the surveillance landscape \u2013 which they consider central to Obama\u2019s presidential legacy \u2013 would require Obama to take an unequivocal position. \u201cOf course this would require congressional legislation to make sure these sorts of changes last, and we need the laws to be changed anyway, but we need his leadership,\u201d said Michelle Richardson of the ACLU.", "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2014 14:47:53 GMT", "tags": ["theguardian.com", "United States", "Privacy", "Barack Obama", "World news", "News", "US politics", "US national security", "NSA", "Surveillance", "Obama administration", "World news"], "title": "Obama to overhaul NSA's bulk storage of Americans' telephone data", "updated": "2014-01-17T14:47:56Z", "author": "Spencer Ackerman", "url": "http://feeds.theguardian.com/c/34708/f/663829/s/3607fd69/sc/1/l/0L0Stheguardian0N0Cworld0C20A140Cjan0C170Cobama0Eend0Ensa0Ebulk0Estorage0Etelephone0Emetadata/story01.htm", "_id": 123870751, "html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"flexible-content-body\" data-display-hint=\"\">\n                \n\t<p>US president Barack Obama will announce that the National Security Agency should no longer store US telephone data in bulk, in a significant change to the most controversial surveillance activity exposed by the Guardian thanks to whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p>\n<p>In a speech Friday morning at the Justice Department, Obama will call for an as-yet unspecified private entity to hold data on telephone calls made in the United States.

Nephi Niven Gabriel Sherman, a New York magazine contributing editor, says he interviewed 614 people for his book. In the corporate thicket of News Corporation, according to a new book, Mr. Ailes dared to battle with Lachlan Murdoch, a son of Rupert Murdoch, the chairman, openly gloating when the younger Mr. Murdoch eventually left his post at the company and even commandeering his chair. At Fox News, the book says, Mr. Ailes was disdainful of even his most bankable on-air talent, privately calling Bill O\u2019Reilly \u201ca book salesman with a TV show\u201d and Brian Kilmeade, a peppy Fox host, \u201ca soccer coach from Long Island.\u201d Those episodes are described in \u201cThe Loudest Voice in the Room\u201d by Gabriel Sherman, a 560-page biography of Mr. Ailes being published on Jan. 21 by Random House. The book aims to be an exhaustive look at Mr. Ailes\u2019s life and his monumental career, particularly as chairman of Fox News Channel. Under his stewardship, the network, known best for its conservative opinion shows in prime time, dominates the cable news competition, frequently posting ratings better than those for its main rivals, MSNBC and CNN, combined. It has also become the most profitable division of 21st Century Fox, its parent, with annual earnings that have been estimated at $1 billion. The book describes in detail Mr. Ailes\u2019s professional ambition, his desire to influence American politics through a conservative prism, and his status as a visionary who possessed an intuitive understanding of the power of television to shape public opinion. Before entering the corporate world, Mr. Ailes was a political consultant, and Mr. Sherman\u2019s book credits him with being a pioneer in using television during election campaigns. In the months before publication, the book has drawn sharp criticism from a chorus of people connected to Fox News, including employees and contributors who have taken to Twitter to attack Mr. Sherman. Mr. Ailes, in what some viewed as an attempt to pre-empt Mr. Sherman\u2019s book, cooperated with another biography, \u201cRoger Ailes: Off Camera\u201d by Zev Chafets, which was published last year by Sentinel, a conservative imprint at Penguin. In his book, Mr. Sherman, a contributing editor at New York magazine, follows Mr. Ailes, 73, from his boyhood in Ohio to his perch as one of the most powerful figures in the history of television. Despite being unsatisfied with many of the Republican candidates for president in 2012, Mr. Ailes endeavored to promote Mitt Romney on Fox News programs, the book says. Before the Wisconsin congressman Paul D. Ryan was chosen as Mr. Romney\u2019s running mate, Mr. Ailes advised Mr. Ryan that his television skills needed work and recommended a speech coach. At the beginning of the general election, a four-minute video criticizing President Obama\u2019s policies was broadcast on \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d provoking outrage from the left and prompting the network to say publicly that Mr. Ailes had no involvement in its creation. In \u201cThe Loudest Voice in the Room,\u201d Mr. Sherman writes that the video \u201cwas Ailes\u2019s brainchild.\u201d The New York Times obtained a copy of the book in advance of its publication. Mr. Sherman said in the source notes that he interviewed 614 people who knew or worked with Mr. Ailes for the book, which took more than three years to report and write. More than 100 pages are devoted to source notes and bibliography. Former employees cited in the book talked of Mr. Ailes\u2019s volatile temper and domineering behavior. In one anecdote, a television producer, Randi Harrison, told Mr. Sherman that while negotiating her salary with Mr. Ailes at NBC in the 1980s, he offered her an additional $100 each week \u201cif you agree to have sex with me whenever I want.\u201d A Fox News spokeswoman said in a statement on Tuesday: \u201cThese charges are false. While we have not read the book, the only reality here is that Gabe was not provided any direct access to Roger Ailes and the book was never fact-checked with Fox News.\u201d The book also describes an explosive episode dating back to 1995, when Mr. Ailes was a high-ranking executive at NBC and locked in a power struggle with another executive, David Zaslav. This article has been revised to reflect the following correction:Correction: January 7, 2014An earlier version of this article misstated the parent company of the Fox News Channel.

Under his stewardship, the network, known best for its conservative opinion shows in prime time, dominates the cable news competition, frequently posting ratings better than those for its main rivals, MSNBC and CNN, combined. It has also become the most profitable division of 21st Century Fox, its parent, with annual earnings that have been estimated at $1 billion. Roger Ailes, left, chairman of the Fox News Channel, and Bill O\u2019Reilly, one of Fox\u2019s stars, in 2012. Brian Ach/Associated Press Images for The Hollywood Reporter The book describes in detail Mr. Ailes\u2019s professional ambition, his desire to influence American politics through a conservative prism, and his status as a visionary who possessed an intuitive understanding of the power of television to shape public opinion. Before entering the corporate world, Mr. Ailes was a political consultant, and Mr. Sherman\u2019s book credits him with being a pioneer in using television during election campaigns.In the months before publication, the book has drawn sharp criticism from a chorus of people connected to Fox News, including employees and contributors who have taken to Twitter to attack Mr. Sherman.Mr. Ailes, in what some viewed as an attempt to pre-empt Mr. Sherman\u2019s book, cooperated with another biography, \u201cRoger Ailes: Off Camera\u201d by Zev Chafets, which was published last year by Sentinel, a conservative imprint at Penguin.In his book, Mr. Sherman, a contributing editor at New York magazine, follows Mr. Ailes, 73, from his boyhood in Ohio to his perch as one of the most powerful figures in the history of television.Despite being unsatisfied with many of the Republican candidates for president in 2012, Mr. Ailes endeavored to promote Mitt Romney on Fox News programs, the book says. Before the Wisconsin congressman Paul D. Ryan was chosen as Mr. Romney\u2019s running mate, Mr. Ailes advised Mr. Ryan that his television skills needed work and recommended a speech coach.At the beginning of the general election, a four-minute video criticizing President Obama\u2019s policies was broadcast on \u201cFox and Friends,\u201d provoking outrage from the left and prompting the network to say publicly that Mr. Ailes had no involvement in its creation. In \u201cThe Loudest Voice in the Room,\u201d Mr. Sherman writes that the video \u201cwas Ailes\u2019s brainchild.\u201dThe New York Times obtained a copy of the book in advance of its publication.Mr. Sherman said in the source notes that he interviewed 614 people who knew or worked with Mr. Ailes for the book, which took more than three years to report and write. More than 100 pages are devoted to source notes and bibliography.Former employees cited in the book talked of Mr. Ailes\u2019s volatile temper and domineering behavior. In one anecdote, a television producer, Randi Harrison, told Mr. Sherman that while negotiating her salary with Mr. Ailes at NBC in the 1980s, he offered her an additional $100 each week \u201cif you agree to have sex with me whenever I want.\u201dA Fox News spokeswoman said in a statement on Tuesday: \u201cThese charges are false. While we have not read the book, the only reality here is that Gabe was not provided any direct access to Roger Ailes and the book was never fact-checked with Fox News.\u201d Gabriel Sherman, a New York magazine contributing editor, says he interviewed 614 people for his book. Nephi Niven The book also describes an explosive episode dating back to 1995, when Mr. Ailes was a high-ranking executive at NBC and locked in a power struggle with another executive, David Zaslav.At a company dinner, according to the book, Mr. Ailes made clear he was ready to do battle with Mr. Zaslav. \u201cLet\u2019s kill the S.O.B.,\u201d he told his dining companions, Mr. Sherman writes. At a separate meeting with Mr. Zaslav, the book says, Mr. Ailes was said to have unleashed a vulgar, anti-Semitic slur at his rival.That episode was promptly investigated, at NBC\u2019s behest, by a partner from the firm Proskauer Rose, Mr. Sherman writes. The partner concluded in his internal report that he believed the allegation that Mr. Ailes made an anti-Semitic remark \u2014 an obscene phrase with the words \u201clittle\u201d and \u201cJew\u201d \u2014 was true. Bob Wright, the former chairman and chief executive of NBC who was Mr. Ailes\u2019s boss at the time, is quoted in the book as saying, \u201cMy conclusion was that he probably said it.\u201d Mr. Sherman also cites documentation from the investigation.Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Ailes specifically denied using an anti-Semitic slur against Mr. Zaslav.Mr. Zaslav, now the chief executive of Discovery and one of the most powerful executives in television, also denied it. \u201cWe fought with each other and we fought with a lot of other people,\u201d he said Tuesday in a phone interview. \u201cBut this allegation is false.\u201d He added that he and Mr. Ailes were now friends.In his source notes, Mr. Sherman quotes Mr. Zaslav as denying the episode.Random House, which acquired \u201cThe Loudest Voice in the Room\u201d in December 2010, said that Mr. Sherman was prepared to speak up in the news media to defend the book. An excerpt will run in New York magazine.Both Mr. Sherman and Random House say they are girding for a counterattack from Fox News. Some Fox employees have already denigrated Mr. Sherman publicly, with the prime-time host Sean Hannity calling him a \u201cphony journalist\u201d on Twitter.Last year, lawyers from Fox News met with lawyers from Random House to discuss Mr. Sherman\u2019s book. Fox requested the meeting because it had heard about allegations that might be in the book that it said were inaccurate, and to emphasize that the book had not been fact-checked by Fox News.Theresa Zoro, a spokeswoman for Random House, said in a statement that Mr. Sherman\u2019s book was \u201can objective and rigorously reported account of Roger Ailes\u2019s life and his running of Fox News. We fully stand by the book. If anyone has issues with it, we will respond with the facts as Gabe Sherman has reported them.\u201dMr. Sherman said in an email: \u201cI consider Roger Ailes to be one of the most fascinating, consequential figures in contemporary American life. I wrote this book to shed light on the full scope of his talents and power, which have found their fullest expression at Fox News.\u201d Correction: January 7, 2014 An earlier version of this article misidentified the parent company of the Fox News Channel. It is 21st Century Fox, not News Corporation. An earlier version also misidentified the organization that the television producer Randi Harrison was preparing to join. It was NBC, not CNBC.

This will allow more time for the spending bill to clear often lengthy procedural hurdles in the U.S. Senate.\"We hope that they will finish their business by January 18th,\" Cantor said on the House floor.Lawmakers have been trying to reach agreement on the massive funding bill by January 15, when all government spending authority expires for military and domestic discretionary programs and federal agencies.But negotiators on the measure, which sets thousands of budget line items from national parks to Pentagon weapons programs, still have a number of funding and policy issues to resolve that will likely take through this weekend.\"We're getting close, but not quite there yet,\" a House Republican aide said.House Appropriations Committee Chairman Harold Rogers hopes to complete the spending bill by Sunday night or Monday, the aide said.The spending measure is needed as a follow-on to a two-year budget deal negotiated in December to provide some relief from automatic \"sequester\" spending cuts after a battle in October over a government shutdown.Among issues that have caused difficulties for negotiators have been increased funding for implementation of \"Obamacare\" health insurance reforms and funds for heightened financial regulation activities under a reform law passed in 2010.(Reporting by Susan Cornwell and David Lawder; Editing by James Dalgleish)", "published": "Sat, 11 Jan 2014 02:05:41 GMT", "tags": ["politicsNews"], "title": "Congress to pass stopgap funding bill next week: top Republican", "updated": "Sat, 11 Jan 2014 02:05:41 GMT", "author": null, "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/PoliticsNews/~3/uYLg_o0Kwv0/story01.htm", "_id": 129310278, "html": "<html><body><div><div id=\"articleInfo\">\n        <p>\n        <span class=\"location\">WASHINGTON</span> <span class=\"pipe\"> </span> \n        <span class=\"timestamp\">Fri Jan 10, 2014 9:05pm EST</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n\n    <span id=\"articleText\">\n<span id=\"midArticle_start\"/>\n\n<span class=\"focusParagraph\"><p><span class=\"articleLocation\">WASHINGTON</span> (Reuters) - The House of Representatives next week will pass a stop-gap funding measure to prevent a government shutdown for three days as negotiators try to finalize a $1 trillion spending bill, Republican Majority Leader Eric Cantor said on Friday.</p>\n</span><span id=\"midArticle_0\"/><p>Cantor said the \"continuing resolution\" would keep the government open past a midnight Wednesday (0500 GMT) deadline through Saturday, January 18.

The bombings come amid deep polarization as the military-led transition moves forward. Editor's note: This story was updated at 11:15 a.m. to include an additional bombing and fatality. Skip to next paragraph Subscribe Today to the Monitor Click Here for your FREE 30 DAYS ofThe Christian Science MonitorWeekly Digital Edition Four bombings shook Cairo this morning as the deadly insurgency against Egypt's security forces struck the nation's capital on the eve of the third anniversary of the 2011 uprising.An explosives-laden truck was detonated in front of the Cairo security headquarters around 6:30 a.m., killing four police officers. Two small explosions followed in the western part of the capital several hours later, killing one police officer, and were likely caused by small improvised explosive devices, said a police official. A fourth bomb, apparently planted on a road and detonated as security officials drove by, killed one person. Dozens of people were wounded in the attacks, which left heaps of rubble at the foot of the crumbling security headquarters facade and air conditioning units dangling out of broken windows.With the largest bombing carried out on a Friday morning, the start of the weekend, when Cairo's streets are largely empty, the bombings appeared intended to target police while largely avoiding civilian casualties. That fits the pattern of many previous attacks against Egyptian security forces, which have been growing since the popularly backed coup that removed former president Mohamed Morsi, and the subsequent violent crackdown on the former Muslim Brotherhood leader's supporters.The apparently coordinated bombings come amid deep polarization in Egypt as the military-led transition process moves forward. Egyptians approved a new Constitution in a referendum last week, and dates for presidential and parliamentary elections are to be announced soon, with many Egyptians urging Army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to run for president. But many Egyptians opposed the military coup and subsequent transition, and the bombings are stoking fears that the violent backlash many warned of after police killed hundreds of Morsi supporters in August had become a reality.Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim called the bombing a \u201cvile terrorist act\u201d and vowed that police would continue their \u201cwar on terrorism.\u201d Mr. Ibrahim survived an assassination attempt in September. No group has yet claimed responsibility for today's attacks. But bystanders at the site of the first bombing in Cairo this morning, and others throughout the capital, were quick to blame the Muslim Brotherhood. The government has labeled the Brotherhood a terrorist organization, and government officials regularly use such language to refer to the group. Officials initially accused the Brotherhood of a Dec. 24 bombing that killed 16 people, even though a separate organization claimed responsibility for the attack. The Brotherhood, which renounced such violence decades ago, condemned the attack in a message posted on its English-language Twitter feed. Peaceful revolution against a \"fascist military coup is the only is the only path chosen by Egyptians to restore their freedoms,\" the message read, adding that the group holds the \"coup authorities\" responsible for deteriorating security and failures to apprehend the perpetrators of previous bombings.An apparently impromptu crowd gathered at the debris-littered site of the bombing soon after the blast, demonstrating angrily against the Islamist organization. \u201cThe people demand the execution of the Brotherhood!\u201d they chanted. Others declared the bombers to be infidels.\u201cThis is black terrorism. It's the Brotherhood,\u201d said one area resident as she stood at a police cordon and watched security forces attempt to drain the water from the blast's crater in the street. \u201cThey began this terrorism, and they're destroying our country.\u201dThe woman, who refused to give her name, said she awoke in her nearby apartment to the sound of the blast and came out to find \u201ceverything destroyed.\u201d Another woman wandered through the site, stepping over bits of broken glass, twisted metal, and shredded paper with tears running down her cheeks. Anger at the USMany in the crowd were also angry at the United States. One man raised a picture of Gen. Sisi, who deposed Morsi, and railed against the US for \u201csupporting terrorism and the Muslim Brotherhood.\u201d Some focused their anger at the US on foreign reporters, and several journalists were assaulted by angry crowds. The blast also hit the Museum of Islamic Art across the street from the security headquarters. The building's facade was heavily damaged, and damage was visible inside the building. Egypt's antiquities minister visited the museum two hours after the blast and said there had been extensive damage to antiquities housed in the museum, which had recently been renovated.The bombings were the latest attacks in an insurgency that has grown since the military ousted Morsi and security forces killed more than 1,000 of his supporters. Since then, the bombings that were relatively common in Egypt's lawless Sinai peninsula have spread to the rest of Egypt, with small attacks on police checkpoints and police stations giving way to larger bombings.The Sinai-based militant group Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis (Supporters of Jerusalem), which has expressed admiration for Al Qaeda, has claimed responsibility for a number of attacks. Those include the car bomb assassination attempt on the interior minister last fall, as well as the deadly December bombing in the Nile Delta city of Mansoura. Police were on high alert throughout the capital after the attacks, and many Egyptians expressed worry about what will happen Saturday, the anniversary of the 2011 uprising against Mr. Mubarak.

The abuses are said to include \u201ctramline injuries,\u201d linear bruises from being beaten with a rod. Carter-Ruck, via Reuters BEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Emaciated corpses lie in the sand, their ribs protruding over sunken bellies, their thighs as thin as wrists. Several show signs of strangulation. The images conjure memories of some of history\u2019s worst atrocities.Numbers inscribed on more than 11,000 bodies in 55,000 photographs said to emerge from the secret jails of Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, suggest that torture, starvation and execution are widespread and even systematic, each case logged with bureaucratic detail.This collection of images was identified as having been part of a voluminous archive of torture and execution maintained by the Syrian government and smuggled out by a police photographer who defected and was given the code name Caesar.So far, only a few photographs have actually been released by lawyers commissioned by the Qatari government, an avowed opponent of Mr. Assad, and the claims about their origins could not be independently verified. Related Coverage If genuine, the trove is new visual corroboration that Mr. Assad\u2019s government is guilty of mass war crimes against its own citizens, just as it appeared to regain some international standing. The photographs were released as delegates from the Syrian government and the opposition began gathering in Switzerland for long-awaited talks to find a political solution to end almost three years of civil war. Obama administration officials, who never fully backed the rebel movement to oust Mr. Assad, had shifted instead to pushing his opponents to sit down with his envoys. Mr. Assad had begun talking confidently of his essential role in a common struggle against terrorist threats.But just as the use of chemical weapons last summer spurred Washington to threaten military action against Mr. Assad\u2019s government, prompting it to give up its chemical arsenal, the new dossier complicates hopes among some of Mr. Assad\u2019s supporters that the West has no choice but to reach a political accommodation with him.Human rights groups had already documented the government\u2019s systematic use of torture, forced disappearances and other abuses. But the quantity and the chilling detail of the visual evidence, if authenticated, may be much harder to dismiss, even in a conflict that has often been defined by dueling images of atrocities on both sides.The Qatari government hired a team of international law experts with experience prosecuting war crimes to validate the photographs and to help explain what they reveal. The investigators say releasing more images might identify the defector, endangering his family or former colleagues, and, they say, they cannot release the images out of respect for the victims\u2019 families.Mr. Assad\u2019s enemies say they hope the leak, first reported in The Guardian and on CNN, will cause enough revulsion in the West to prevent any deal that might leave him in place, or perhaps prod the West into more muscular steps to remove him, just as the disclosure of the Serbian massacre at Srebrenica in 1995 moved NATO to launch airstrikes in the Balkans.But even the most determined advocates of Western intervention say the images may dramatize the moral cost of inaction but are unlikely to change the policy, especially given the American aversion to another entanglement in the Middle East.\u201cI feel like we have had at least one or two Srebrenica moments in Syria already,\u201d said Robert Kagan, a scholar at the Brookings Institution who has pushed for American action. \u201cThe White House has completely hardened itself to whatever horrendous news might come out of Syria because the president doesn\u2019t want to get involved.\u201dThe photos were made public by an anonymous military policeman who had a grim role in the bureaucracy of the Syrian security apparatus, according to the lawyers\u2019 report assessing the photos\u2019 veracity.The photos were used to provide death certificates to the families of the victims without turning over the bodies, and were archived as a record that the men had been killed.After \u201cpsychological suffering\u201d caused by his job, Caesar saved the photos on a portable disk drive, and he and the disk were smuggled out of the country by antigovernment activists, the report said. The activists contacted the Qatari government, Qatar hired a London law firm, and it commissioned a team of legal and forensics experts to assess the credibility of Caesar and his photos.\u201cIt was like getting the keys to the Nazi archive,\u201d said Geoffrey Nice, one of the investigators, who previously served as the lead prosecutor in the trial of the former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic.Rarely, Mr. Nice said, had war crimes prosecutors received so much information from a single source. It was \u201can enormous amount of material in one go,\u201d he said.The team, which included three legal experts with experience in war crimes prosecutions and three forensic analysts, interviewed Caesar extensively, examined the photos and deemed them to be credible evidence that could support charges of crimes against humanity and possibly war crimes.\u201cIt is very rare to have this kind of government-backed, industrial, machinelike, systematic torture and killing of human beings, the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen since Nuremberg,\u201d said David Crane, an investigator involved in examining the photos, who previously indicted President Charles G. Taylor of Liberia.That Qatar, which has bankrolled the rebels, funded the project is also likely to raise questions, though the investigators say they worked freely.The Syrian government, which characterizes the insurgency as a terrorist campaign backed by foreign powers, has not commented on the report.At the site of the peace conference, a Syrian journalist who supports the government said the timing of the release suggested a plan to undermine the Syrian government, and he questioned the photos\u2019 authenticity.\u201cWho are these people?\u201d he said, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. \u201cAre they innocent political prisoners or are they Al Qaeda?\u201dHuman rights groups have long accused the Syrian government of such systematic abuses, especially since the start of the uprising three years ago.\u201cIf these photographs are authentic, the torture documented is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the atrocities that are happening across the country,\u201d said Lama Fakih, one author of a 2012 report by Human Rights Watch based on interviews with more than 200 former detainees and inspections of former government torture facilities in rebel-held territory.In Washington, Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, said the images \u201cshow systematic violations of Syrians\u2019 human rights.\u201d\u201cWe have been committed to ensuring that Bashar al-Assad, who is the one responsible for these horrific images, cannot go on leading his country,\u201d she said, citing American efforts in the peace conference.While the report\u2019s authors hope it will create momentum for the prosecution of war crimes in Syria, they acknowledge that international politics are likely to block such action. Russia, a major Syrian ally, would probably veto any effort by the United Nations Security Council to refer Syria to the International Criminal Court in The Hague.Others recalled how the Obama administration initially threatened missile strikes against the Syrian government after videos emerged depicting hundreds of victims of a chemical weapons attack launched by Mr. Assad\u2019s forces.\u201cHistory is full of leaders who have warned against inaction, indifference and especially against silence when it mattered most,\u201d Secretary of State John Kerry said in an emotional address last summer, calling Mr. Assad \u201ca thug\u201d and \u201ca murderer.\u201dPeter D. Feaver, a Duke University political scientist who studies foreign policy and public opinion, said that it was an \u201ceerie parallel\u201d but that the administration is \u201cin a very different place\u201d now, investing instead in a deal with Mr. Assad to turn over his chemical weapons and a push for a negotiated end to the war.Mr. Feaver imagined that the images might provide new ammunition to those who want \u201cto go into the Oval Office, throw it down on the desk, and say, \u2018If we don\u2019t act, this is on us!\u2019 \u201dAhmed al-Ahmed, an activist in central Syria, said through Skype: \u201cThe report is nothing new for us. It just documented what has been going on all along.\u201d\u201cThere were many photos before these that were even worse,\u201d he said. Ben Hubbard reported from Beirut, and David D. Kirkpatrick from Cairo. Anne Barnard contributed reporting from Geneva.

ReutersA group of hawks is called a cast, an aerie, a kettle\u2014or, if John Bolton gets his way, the 114th United States Congress. The one-time U.S. ambassador to the United Nations has set up a PAC and a super PAC to help hawks in the 2014 midterms, and is insistent that foreign policy should be prominent in American politics. For a man dedicated to that subject, however, he has a curious blind spot. Here's an exchange the mustachioed raptor-enthusiast had on Hugh Hewitt's radio show: HH: Yesterday on this program, and people can read the transcript if they want at www.hughhewitt.com, and we posted the audio as well of Dr. Charles Krauthammer, hour-long interview like this one. He said that look, national security, foreign policy, just doesn\u2019t really matter in presidential elections. How do you respond to that? JB: Well, I think it has been invisible in the past couple of presidential elections. I think that\u2019s correct. But I think it would be wrong to say it doesn\u2019t matter, that it shouldn\u2019t matter, and that it couldn\u2019t matter. The fact is we now face threats around the world that are growing, some are great strategic threats, some are more immediate, but I think these threats have a direct impact on the economic well-being of the American people. I think the American people are very practical. And if they have leaders who address these issues, I think they will respond to them. I think foreign and defense policy are really surrogates for leadership. I think the people look at how our candidates address national security issues, and they say yes or no, yes, that person is qualified to sit behind the big desk at the White House. So leaving them behind is bad policy for the country. I think it\u2019s bad politics, too. Even accounting for Ron Paul's monologues in the primary, Mitt Romney's attempted Benghazi zings, and President Obama's crowing over killing Osama bin Laden, it's fair to say that foreign policy was relatively irrelevant during the 2012 election. But the 2008 election? Hillary Clinton probably would have won the Democratic primary if not for the fact that she supported the Iraq War while her rival opposed it. Then the general election pitted a war-hero Iraq hawk against an anti-war Democrat. What hawks can't seem to internalize is that Barack Obama didn't beat John McCain because foreign policy wasn't an issue. He beat him, in part, because foreign policy was a winning issue for Obama.

The one-time U.S. ambassador to the United Nations has set up a <a href=\"http://www.boltonpac.com/\">PAC</a> and a super PAC to help hawks in the 2014 midterms, and is insistent that foreign policy should be prominent in American politics. For a man dedicated to that subject, however, he has a curious blind spot.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Here's <a href=\"http://www.hughhewitt.com/ambassador-john-bolton-benghazi-iran-obama-hillarys-failure-foreign-policy/\">an exchange</a> the mustachioed raptor-enthusiast had on Hugh Hewitt's radio show:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>HH: Yesterday on this program, and people can read the transcript if they want at www.hughhewitt.com, and we posted the audio as well of Dr. Charles Krauthammer, hour-long interview like this one. He said that look, national security, foreign policy, just doesn\u2019t really matter in presidential elections. How do you respond to that?</p>\n\n<p>JB: <strong>Well, I think it has been invisible in the past couple of presidential elections</strong>. I think that\u2019s correct. But I think it would be wrong to say it doesn\u2019t matter, that it shouldn\u2019t matter, and that it couldn\u2019t matter. The fact is we now face threats around the world that are growing, some are great strategic threats, some are more immediate, but I think these threats have a direct impact on the economic well-being of the American people. I think the American people are very practical. And if they have leaders who address these issues, I think they will respond to them. I think foreign and defense policy are really surrogates for leadership. I think the people look at how our candidates address national security issues, and they say yes or no, yes, that person is qualified to sit behind the big desk at the White House. So leaving them behind is bad policy for the country. I think it\u2019s bad politics, too.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even accounting for Ron Paul's monologues in the primary, Mitt Romney's attempted Benghazi <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/09/heres-a-timeline-of-the-confusing-statements-on-libya-and-egypt/262264/\">zings</a>, and President Obama's crowing over killing Osama bin Laden, it's fair to say that foreign policy was relatively irrelevant during the 2012 election.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>But the 2008 election?\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Hillary Clinton probably would have won the Democratic primary if not for the fact that she supported the Iraq War while her rival opposed it. Then the general election pitted a war-hero Iraq hawk against an anti-war Democrat. What hawks can't seem to internalize is that Barack Obama didn't beat John McCain because foreign policy wasn't an issue. He beat him, in part, because foreign policy was a winning issue <em>for Obama</em>.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>Or perhaps it's more accurate to say that it was a losing issue for the Republican Party.

A version of this post originally appeared on the Lesley on Africa blog. The views expressed are the author's own. Skip to next paragraph Recent posts Subscribe Today to the Monitor Click Here for your FREE 30 DAYS ofThe Christian Science MonitorWeekly Digital Edition Last week, Nigeria announced the creation of an Army Special Operations Command (NASOC) at a Counter-Terrorism and Counter-Insurgency Lessons Learned Exchange between the United States and Nigeria. I\u2019d been tracking developments with regard to bilateral security cooperation and had heard about the creation of NASOC when I was in Nigeria last summer, which is why this announcement piqued my interest.According to the Nigerian Army\u2019s Chief of Transformation and Innovation, NASOC would be a \u201clow density high level strategic utility force capable of conducting direct action at low visibility operations. NASOC operation will be governed by precision of conduct, accuracy, timely speed and execution, surprise to keep any adversary off balance while in special operations.\u201d (I\u2019m not gonna lie \u2013 I have no clue what this quote actually means, but I digress.)Through US Africa Command (AFRICOM), US Special Operations Command, Africa (SOCAFRICA), and the Office of Security Cooperation in the US Embassy in Abuja, the United States will be helping stand up the NASOC by providing training and a limited amount of equipment.From the information I have, it sounds like NASOC will have a force up North to deal with Boko Haram, a force in the South to deal with security in the Niger Delta, a headquarters force to focus on hostage rescue, and an expeditionary force for external use \u2013 perhaps to contribute specialized capabilities for peacekeeping operations.Unfortunately, I don\u2019t know the precise size of NASOC or of its component forces. The announcement of the NASOC preceded President Goodluck Jonathan\u2019s sacking of some of his Chiefs of Defense (the equivalent of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the United States) a few days later.As part of this reshuffle, former Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Alex Badeh, took over from Admiral Ola Sa'ad Ibrahim as Chief of Defense Staff (position equivalent to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the US), Air Vice Marshal Adesola Nunayon Amosu took over for Badeh as Chief of Air Staff (position equivalent to the Air Force Chief of Staff in the US), Major General Kenneth Tobiah Jacob Minimah took over for Lieutenant General Azubike O. Ihejirika as Chief of Army Staff (position equivalent to the Army Chief of Staff in the US), and Rear Admiral Usman O. Jibrin took over from Vice Admiral Dele Joseph Ezeoba as Chief of Naval Staff (position equivalent to the Chief of Naval Operations in the US).Air Marshal Badeh, the new Chief of Defense Staff, hails from Adamawa state, which is one of three Nigerian states (the others being Borno and Yobe states) in which President Jonathan had declared a Boko Haram-related state of emergency that is set to expire in April 2014, unless it is renewed for a second time.At the moment, I do not know what, if any correlation there is between the Chiefs of Defense reshuffle and the establishment of NASOC to counter the Boko Haram insurgency. One reason US support to establish NASOC is significant is that I have not gotten the sense that the US military had as strong service-to-service relations with the Nigerian military as it would like, and working with them to establish NASOC provides opportunities to strengthen the Army-to-Army relationship.In addition, as a new command, NASOC will need to create military units from scratch, which avoids some of the tensions surrounding the vetting needed under the Leahy Amendment that have impeded bilateral security cooperation as a result of the Nigerian government\u2019s heavy-handed approach to Boko Haram in the North.(The Leahy Amendment requires that partner- nation military units that receive US security assistance are vetted to ensure that they have not been implicated in gross human rights violations.) Just to give you an example of the extent to which allegations of human rights violations by the Nigerian military had recently affected Leahy vetting: One of the ways the United States provides security assistance to Nigeria and other countries on the African continent is through Africa Contingency Operations Training and Assistance (ACOTA), which trains partner nation forces to participate in peacekeeping operations. You may recall that during the first six months of 2013, Nigeria contributed approximately one-sixth of the troops to the African-led International Support Mission to Mali (AFISMA) before they had to withdraw most of their troops in July. These troops likely received ACOTA training prior to their deployment.In April, Human Rights Watch published satellite imagery from the town of Baga in Borno State, showing 2,275 destroyed and 125 severely damaged buildings, and asking the Nigerian government to investigate allegations that soldiers carried out widespread destruction and killing in the town.Although the Baga incident was just one of many allegations of human rights violations by the Nigerian military in its fight against Boko Haram, my understanding is that most military units rotate personnel through northern Nigeria, and as a result, Nigerian military units were becoming tainted by association as far as Leahy vetting goes.As a result, Nigeria\u2019s domestic handling of Boko Haram was raising questions over whether the United States would be able to support Nigerian troop contributions to Mali and other peacekeeping missions.Thus to bring us back to the establishment of NASOC and the US military\u2019s support for this effort \u2013 will the newly-created \u201dclean\u201d NASOC units be able to avoid the human rights violations that have restricted the space for US military engagement with their non-special forces counterparts?

These troops likely received ACOTA training prior to their deployment.</p><p>In April, Human Rights Watch published\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/related_material/HRW_Baga_Damages_v1-2_0.pdf\" target=\"_self\">satellite imagery</a>\u00a0from the\u00a0town of\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baga,_Nigeria\" target=\"_self\">Baga</a>\u00a0in\u00a0<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borno_State\" target=\"_self\">Borno State</a>, showing\u00a02,275 destroyed and 125 severely damaged buildings, and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/05/01/nigeria-massive-destruction-deaths-military-raid\" target=\"_self\">asking the Nigerian government to investigate</a>\u00a0allegations that\u00a0soldiers carried out widespread destruction and killing in the town.</p><p>Although the Baga incident was just one of many allegations of human rights violations by the Nigerian military in its fight against Boko Haram, my understanding is that most military units rotate personnel through northern Nigeria, and as a result, Nigerian military units were becoming tainted by association as far as Leahy vetting goes.</p><p>As a result, Nigeria\u2019s domestic handling of Boko Haram was\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2013/05/208720.htm#NIGERIA\" target=\"_self\">raising questions</a>\u00a0over whether the United States would be able to support\u00a0Nigerian troop contributions to Mali and other peacekeeping missions.</p><p>Thus to bring us back to the establishment of NASOC and the US military\u2019s support for this effort \u2013 will the\u00a0newly-created \u201dclean\u201d\u00a0NASOC units be able to avoid the human rights violations that have restricted the space for US military engagement with their non-special forces counterparts?</p>\n\t\t\n\t\t<p id=\"ndn-video-single-02\" class=\"ndn-widget\"/>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div id=\"blog_disclaimer\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>The Christian Science Monitor has assembled a diverse group of Africa bloggers.

FOR reasons as hazy as a cloud of Sour Diesel smoke, the number 420 is cherished by America\u2019s stoners. So it was fitting that on January 1st, 420 days after Coloradans awoke to discover that, along with Washington state, theirs had become the first jurisdiction in the world to vote to remove the criminal prohibition on recreational marijuana, around 40 state-licensed pot shops flung open their doors to all-comers. Four-hour queues snaked along the streets of Denver and other cities.

For optimists, the votes in Colorado and Washington suggest that America\u2019s war on drugs is finally winding down. The casualties have been legion: 750,000 people are arrested each year for marijuana alone; the subsequent blotted records can derail lives. Some 40,000 people languish in prison for pot-related offences. Murderous gangs fill the supply gap created by prohibition. In this sectionRelated topics Public opinion appears to have reached a tipping point. Most Americans now favour legalisation; something that was unthinkable a generation ago (see chart). Advocates have waged savvy campaigns, gaining footholds by legalising marijuana for medical purposes (so far in 20 states and Washington, DC) and presenting a clean-cut, besuited image worlds away from the tie-dyed stereotypes. More states may free the weed before long. Yet legalisation is just the beginning of a process, and Colorado and Washington have taken different routes. Colorado has built on the foundations of its medical-marijuana system. Until October (and 2016 in Denver) only medical-marijuana operators may receive licences to serve recreational customers, which is why many of the shops that welcomed newcomers on January 1st have names like Citi-Med and Evergreen Apothecary. (Retailers exult that they are no longer obliged to speak of \u201cmedicine\u201d and \u201cpatients\u201d.) During this time Colorado\u2019s retailers must grow at least 70% of the marijuana they sell. Washington, by contrast, is creating a recreational market from scratch; this is why its shops are not expected to open until May or so. It will have a three-tier system, with separate licences for cultivation, processing and retail. The state will determine, Soviet-style, consumers\u2019 annual needs in advance and cap overall production. The fate of its medical system, more chaotic than Colorado\u2019s, is uncertain. Under federal law, marijuana remains illegal. The feds have pounced on dispensaries in states with badly run medical systems. But in August the Department of Justice suggested it would let the experiments in Washington and Colorado proceed if they did not impede eight \u201cenforcement priorities\u201d, including stopping pot from being trafficked by gangs, sold to minors or smuggled into other states. Worryingly for Colorado, its record in these areas is not stellar. Plenty of teenagers are getting their hands on medical marijuana procured by adults. Police in neighbouring states such as Kansas complain of Coloradan marijuana flooding border areas. Colorado has a fat rule book and most dispensaries are well run, but they can do little about customers passing pot to children or taking it across state lines. And in Colorado (but not Washington) anyone may grow up to six marijuana plants without a licence. Legalisation may prompt people to smoke and eat more marijuana. Prices for recreational pot are comparable to those in the illicit market ($55-$60 for an eighth, according to Darin Smith of the Denver Kush Club, a retail outlet). Some non-tokers will surely be tempted to take up the habit now that they need not deal with intimidating criminals in dark alleys; others may get high more often. The ill-effects of marijuana, including cognitive impairment and a risk of dependency, are fairly well documented (though more research would help). Around 20% of users account for 80% of consumption; as Mark Kleiman, an analyst, points out, it is in a profit-seeking industry\u2019s interest to target these problem users. Set against this is the genuine pleasure that smoking or eating marijuana brings millions of adults. Moreover, increased marijuana use may turn out to be a net positive for public health if, as some studies suggest, it replaces some consumption of alcohol\u2014a far more destructive drug by most measures. That is not the only reason for officials to welcome legal weed. Hefty excise and sales taxes will boost state coffers. In Colorado the Department of Revenue oversees regulation; this, says Sam Kamin, a law professor at the University of Denver, is good news for the industry, for \u201cmarijuana may not be addictive, but money certainly is\u201d. The costs of enforcement\u2014including 22 field inspectors\u2014will be more than covered by the fresh revenue. Perhaps the biggest sign of change is that even foes of legalisation accept the need to try to make it work. All-out drug warriors are hard to find in Colorado. For their part, campaigners now focus on technical matters. For example, many pot businesses struggle to obtain basic financial services because banks fear violating federal money-laundering rules.

But the victims have pressed for publication of the files, arguing that the documents will provide an important form of reckoning, chronicling what church officials did, and did not do, when they learned of accusations that priests had molested minors.\u201cThere can\u2019t be safety in the future unless practices that were so dangerous in the past are fully known,\u201d said Jeff Anderson, a lawyer representing many of the victims. \u201cIt really is a painful and sorrowful and frankly ugly portrait of what has been, but from that, there is hope that it will not be repeated, and to that end it brings comfort to survivors.\u201dThe documents are certain to place an uncomfortable spotlight on Cardinal Francis E. George, the archbishop of Chicago, who is one of the leading intellectuals in the American church hierarchy and who was president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops from 2007 to 2010, when many dioceses were grappling with the abuse crisis. Although the abuse took place before Cardinal George became archbishop, many of the victims first came forward after his arrival; some of the files concern cases in which Cardinal George\u2019s response has been questioned, including that of the Rev. Joseph R. Bennett, whose disciplinary proceeding the cardinal briefly delayed, and the Rev. Norbert J. Maday, whose prison sentence the cardinal sought to reduce.\u201cIt would be a great fulfillment of the millennium spirit to see your captive heart set free,\u201d Cardinal George wrote to the incarcerated Father Maday in 2000. But the cardinal later changed his mind. In 2007, after several more people had come forward to say they had been abused by Father Maday, the cardinal wrote to a parole commission, saying he was seeking to defrock the priest.The documents also show Cardinal George repeatedly offering to meet with victims of abuse and apologizing; in 2005 he wrote to a victim, \u201cWe have tried to apologize to all those who are suffering because of the failure on the part of some bishops to supervise priests adequately.\u201dThis month, in a letter distributed to parishes, Cardinal George acknowledged that in the 1980s, the archdiocese responded to allegations of sexual abuse \u201csometimes hesitantly,\u201d and that in the 1990s, \u201carchdiocesan policy still allowed some perpetrators a restricted form of ministry, with monitoring, that kept them from regular contact with minors.\u201d He said the response changed in 2002, when the American bishops agreed to a zero-tolerance policy that bars any priest facing a credible accusation of abuse from serving in ministry.\u201cPublishing for all to read the actual records of these crimes raises transparency to a new level,\u201d Cardinal George wrote in the letter. \u201cIt will be helpful, we pray, for some, but painful for many.\u201dThe archdiocese turned the estimated 6,000 pages of documents over to lawyers for abuse victims last Wednesday; the lawyers delayed the release for further redactions to protect victims\u2019 privacy. An archdiocesan lawyer told reporters last week that 95 percent of the allegations in the files concerned conduct before 1988, and none after 1996; 14 of the 30 accused priests are dead, and none is still serving in ministry. Cardinal George, who has been the archbishop of Chicago since 1997, has said he never met many of the accused priests.The documents will also shed new light on the handling of abusers by Cardinal George\u2019s predecessor, Cardinal Joseph L. Bernardin, a highly regarded figure in American Catholic history, and one of the first prominent church figures to act strongly against clergy sexual abuse. Cardinal Bernardin occasionally gave abusive priests second chances \u2014 for example, he allowed the Rev. Joseph L. Fitzharris a new parish assignment, with the caveat that the priest should not be allowed unsupervised contact with high school-age boys, after Father Fitzharris had been charged in court with sexually abusing a 15-year-old.The Archdiocese of Chicago, which is the third largest diocese in the country, has paid about $100 million to settle abuse allegations against priests. The archdiocese has also posted to its website a list of 65 priests \u2014 none still serving in ministry \u2014 who the church said have been credibly accused of abusing minors; the documents to be released Tuesday concern 30 priests whose files were subject to negotiations with victims\u2019 lawyers.The personnel files of accused priests have previously been made public in other American dioceses, including Boston and Los Angeles, generally as a result of litigation. Most of the documents have been published in an online archive, bishop-accountability.org.The release of the Chicago files comes as Cardinal George, a 77-year-old cancer survivor, is awaiting permission from the Vatican to retire. Pope Francis\u2019s choice of a new archbishop of Chicago will be closely watched as it will probably be the pope\u2019s first appointment to lead a major American see.", "published": "Tue, 21 Jan 2014 15:44:04 GMT", "tags": ["Chicago (Ill)", "Sex Crimes", "Roman Catholic Church", "George, Francis E"], "title": "Chicago Archdiocese Releases Records of Abuse Complaints", "updated": "Tue, 21 Jan 2014 15:44:04 GMT", "author": "By MICHAEL PAULSON", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/us/chicago-archdiocese-records-of-abuse-complaints.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "_id": 160177017, "html": "<html><body><div><article id=\"story\" class=\"story theme-main\">\n\n    <header class=\"story-header\">\n                <div class=\"story-meta\">\n                        \n            <h1 itemprop=\"headline\" class=\"story-heading\">Records of Abuse Complaints Against Priests in Chicago Archdiocese Are Released</h1>\n\n                        <div class=\"story-meta-footer\">\n                                \n\n<p class=\"byline-dateline\"><span class=\"byline\" itemprop=\"author creator\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\">By <span class=\"byline-author\" data-byline-name=\"MICHAEL PAULSON\" itemprop=\"name\">MICHAEL PAULSON</span></span><time class=\"dateline\" datetime=\"2014-01-21\">JAN. 21, 2014</time>\n</p>                \n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </header>\n\n    \n    \n\n                \n    <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"256\" data-total-count=\"256\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Thousands of documents detailing the Archdiocese of Chicago\u2019s often halting response to sexual abuse allegations against 30 priests <a title=\"Documents\" href=\"http://www.abusedinchicago.com/Archdiocese-of-Chicago-Documents.aspx\">were posted online Tuesday </a>after eight years of negotiations between victim advocates and Roman Catholic Church officials.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"448\" data-total-count=\"704\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Most of the abuse was alleged to have taken place years ago, about half of the accused priests are dead and many of the victims have already been given financial settlements from the archdiocese.

What is the difference between loving one's country and loving the government? What is freedom of speech -- or, for that matter, freedom? With Facebook, Youtube, Twitter and major news outlets like the New York Times and Bloomberg all effectively banned in China, and Chinese state media muzzled as always, it's getting increasingly difficult for Chinese citizens to answer -- or even ask -- questions like these. But Zhihu, an online platform that allows Chinese web users to pose and engage the hard questions could challenge the status quo. Meaning 'do you know' in Chinese, Zhihu is an interactive, online platform similar to Quora.com where anyone can post questions, with the best responses upvoted by others. Featuring high-profile Chinese entrepreneurs and public intellectuals among its users, Zhihu is increasingly providing Chinese netizens with a space for rich discussion, one surprisingly free -- at least for now -- from government censorship. With what a representative claims are 40 million monthly visitors, Zhihu is still far less popular than platforms like Sina Weibo, which boasts 500 million registered users. But over the past six months Weibo, once a promising avenue for free speech, has increasingly fallen under government control. The result is a space increasingly filled with celebrity news, photos of food, and reposts of the latest viral memes -- one losing the free-wheeling candor that once made it so promising to free-speech advocates. That's why Wei Wuhui, a technology expert at Shanghai Jiaotong University, called Zhihu \"a step up from Weibo.\" Because it focuses on answering questions, rather than simply sharing information, it is \"more valuable for Chinese society,\" said Wei. Zhihu provides a home for the discussions that were never allowed in China's state education system. Taiwanese and Mainland Chinese debate the hypothetical political processes required for reunification; other users sophisticated arguments about the fraught relations between Chinese ethnic minorities and the Han, who make up roughly 92 percent of the population. Some of the repartee that results from sensitive topics can be both humorous and tragic. One commenter asked about the most common way for intellectuals to commit suicide during the anarchic, decade-long Cultural Revolution; another responded, \"Tell the truth.\" \"Do Taiwanese generally dislike Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou, and if so, why,\" was a popular question -- and one of the most popular answers was yes, \"because they can\" in Taiwan's democratic society. Relatively open discussions like these help explain why Zhihu's following has grown rapidly since its founding in January 2011. In a country where the education system and media are firmly controlled by a Chinese Communist Party that seeks to command public opinion, some citizens hunger for other, freer forms of information. In an interview Huang Jixin, co-founder of Zhihu, said that citizens with spending power now want high-quality information, not just high quality goods. A former journalist -- and on Twitter, a self-described \"incurable optimist\" and \"pathetic liberal\" -- Huang said he became frustrated with traditional media's requirement that he cover subjects about which he had only superficial knowledge. He and his co-founders \"felt there had to be something more than journalism\" to generate content. To be sure, when topics veer beyond the edgy and into the forbidden, Zhihu self-censors. Like Weibo and the popular messaging service WeChat, the site often deletes posts it thinks the government wouldn't approve. The Zhihu user agreement clearly forbids posting anything that \"spreads rumors, disrupts social order, or breaks social stability\" -- clear keywords for political heterodoxy. It's not hard to see that prohibition in action: A search for \"six-four\" in Chinese, code for the 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising and subsequent crackdown, sometimes returns a 404 message, temporarily preventing the user from logging in. Wei captured this tension by praising and shaming the site in the same breath: \"Out of all the platforms available to Internet users in China, Zhihu is one of the best places for deep and meaningful discussions,\" as long as users \"don't have any deep and meaningful discussions about topics deemed to be sensitive by the Chinese government.\" Zhihu users have questioned Huang about what exactly Zhihu deems fit to delete. In one discussion he admitted that sometimes the site's team \"has no choice but to clench their teeth and delete certain content.\" But he argued that Zhihu was ultimately one of the good guys: \"Anything that promotes the free flow of information is, in its heart of hearts, a good thing.\" Screenshot from Zhihu.com", "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 18:55:24 +0000", "tags": ["Default", "Web Exclusive", "Free", "Tea Leaf Nation", "East Asia", "China", "Democracy", "Internet", "TLN"], "title": "In China, A New Space for New Questions", "updated": "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 18:55:24 +0000", "author": "SUE-LIN WONG", "url": "http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/01/16/let_100_questions_bloom_China_cyberspace_political_speech", "_id": 162075670, "html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"prose with_large_first_letter\"><p>&#13;\nOut of democracy, rule of law and freedom, what does China\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.zhihu.com/question/21096486\">most need</a>\u00a0now?

Tuesday\u2019s decision follows a government circular which strongly recommends regional prefects to ban Dieudonn\u00e9 if they believe that his show could lead to \u201ccriminal offences\u201d.Under the French constitution the national government cannot, in theory, issue a blanket ban on theatrical performances. It is up to regional prefects \u2013 the senior national government officials in charge of policing and other matters - to take decisions based on local considerations.In practice, the wording of the circular issued by the interior minister, Manuel Valls, on Monday offered them little choice. President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande removed any doubt by calling on the prefects on Tuesday to be \u201cvigilant and inflexible\u201d in implementing the recommended ban.It also emerged on Tuesday that the landlords of the theatre in Paris which permanently hosts Dieudonn\u00e9\u2019s one-man show have decided to give the comedian notice to quit the premises.Mr Valls say that Dieudonn\u00e9\u2019s act \u2013 which mocks the Holocaust and accuses Jews of running the world \u2013 is no longer artistic or comic but is a form of extremist political rally. The comedian\u2019s lawyers announced that they would seek an injunction to overturn the ban.They have a good chance of succeeding. Several previous attempts to prevent him from appearing have been struck down in the courts in recent years as an infringement of liberty of expression.The decision to, in effect, censor Dieudonn\u00e9 had also been criticised by civil liberties pressure groups, centre-right politicians and the respected centre-left newspaper, Le Monde. The French branch of the League of Human Rights said that a blanket ban would \u201crally support for Dieudonn\u00e9 for those who consider themselves oppressed\u201d.Dieudonne M\u2019bala Mbala, 47, whose father was from Cameroon and whose mother is Breton, has a string of convictions for inciting hatred against Jews. His latest show includes a sketch which has resulted in another formal investigation for \u201cincitement to racial hatred\u201d.Talking about a well-known French-Jewish radio presenter, Dieudonn\u00e9 says: \u201cWhen the wind turns, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll have time to pack a suitcase. When I hear Patrick Cohen talking, you see, I think of gas chambers. Pity.\u201dTen days ago the French footballer Nicolas Anelka brought the controversy surrounding Dieudonne across the Channel. After scoring a goal for West Bromwich Albion at Upton Park, Anelka performed \u201cla quenelle\u201d, the provocative gesture invented by the comedian.Anelka said the gesture was in \u201csolidarity with his friend, Dieudonn\u00e9, who was already facing a ban in France.

Yee/The New York Times Chinese tourists taking in the sights in New York. Chinese perceptions of the United States, it often seems, are colored by their feelings toward China. Helen Gao writes an occasional column on overseas education for cn.nytimes.com, the Chinese-language website of The New York Times. This piece is adapted from a column published shortly after the Lunar New Year in 2013. A fter studying in the United States for seven years, I was once again sitting at my grandmother\u2019s table in Beijing. In front of me lay the dishes she had prepared for my visit: a steamed carp, laced with strands of cilantro; julienne potatoes stir-fried with green pepper; saut\u00e9ed celery slices; braised pork cubes and eggs. \u201cWhen are you going back to America this time?\u201d Grandma asked, placing a piece of fish on my plate. \u201cI\u2019m staying this time.\u201d She raised her eyebrows. I told her I hoped to do freelance writing in China and be close to home after all the years abroad. She nodded, but then shook her head. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have returned if I were you.\u201d Grandma peppered me with questions as I nibbled on the fish. What was I working on? What was the reporting process like? Did I take China\u2019s side? She was once a journalist herself, having worked for state-owned newspapers from the early 1950s to the mid-1980s. I told her I was writing about the strike at Southern Weekend, a liberal Chinese newspaper, after state censors meddled with an editorial last winter. \u201cThe censorship at the paper has always been very severe,\u201d I said. \u201cFrankly, I\u2019m surprised the reporters put up with it for so long. If I were one of them\u2026\u201d Grandma cut me off. \u201cOf course you are surprised. You\u2019ve been abroad too long,\u201d she snapped, putting down her chopsticks with a clatter. \u201cThis is just the way Chinese journalism works. Do you understand? China is not America!\u201d I opened my mouth to explain, but Grandma went on. The words \u201csuperior,\u201d \u201cignorant,\u201d and \u201chalf-American\u201d flew by my ears. I kept my eyes on my plate and ate the fish, trying hard to swallow. I left China for the first time in 2005, at the age of 17, to attend high school in the United States. I quickly realized that my homeland, when viewed from the outside, looked very different from what I was familiar with. In the United States media, Taiwan was its own country. The Tiananmen massacre was better known among my American peers than my Chinese friends. As a native of China, I faced constant questioning: Do you think the one-child policy is necessary? Why are the Chinese so incensed about the Diaoyu Islands? What was the Chinese government doing to ease ethnic tensions in Xinjiang and Tibet? I tried to reply, searching for answers in my mind, but felt as if I were scraping the inside of an empty Nutella jar with a butter knife. So I hit the library, poring over documents and books written by both Chinese and Westerners. Slowly, my understanding of China evolved into something resembling a chaotic Impressionist painting: News and views from West and East juxtaposed each other like clashing colors and shapes, refusing to form a neat image. But it was an image I was eager to share with friends and family at home when I returned to China two years ago. One night at dinner, my mother, an editor in chief at a state publishing house, mentioned a new book she was planning to publish. \u201cIt is about the Jews,\u201d she explained, \u201cand reveals the secret behind their entrepreneurial success.\u201d Her words made me uneasy. I had often heard Chinese talking about Jews in similarly generalized terms. Carefully, I pointed out that the book\u2019s idea sounded like a form of racial stereotyping. \u201cChinese people talk like this all the time, and you know it,\u201d my mother replied, throwing me an impatient look. \u201cIt\u2019s not considered offensive in China.\u201d \u201cBut should China have its own standard for racial sensitivity?\u201d I asked. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem right to hold assumptions toward races anywhere in the world. In America, my friends don\u2019t \u2014\u201d \u201cJust because they do it in America, it doesn\u2019t mean we have to do the same in China,\u201d she interrupted, raising her voice. \u201cThe years you spent in America have got those ideas into your head, and now everything in China seems wrong to you!\u201d I forget how I responded, but I remember the suffocating silence in the room afterward. Often, I find conversations about China with Chinese relatives and friends trickier to navigate than those with American acquaintances. In America, my firsthand perspective of China gave me credibility and strengthened my stories and arguments. But here in China, my time spent in America seems only to have alienated me from others. If I say something critical, it is often taken not as social commentary but as a sign of shifted loyalty, of contempt for my homeland, of uncritical worship of all things American. Wounded by such misunderstandings, I babble in self-defense. I point out that my complaints echo those of many Chinese about air pollution, food safety, news censorship, corruption and so on. In fact, these gripes dominate discussions on Chinese social media. But such reasoning is usually of little help. The evening after my exchange with Grandma about censorship, my mother sat me down in the living room. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about Chinese journalism like that in front of Grandma in the future,\u201d she said. \u201cBut Grandma complains about it all the time,\u201d I muttered. \u201cGrandma can complain about it,\u201d she said, looking in my eyes. \u201cBut it\u2019s not the same when you do.\u201d When I left China in 2005, my teachers, classmates and relatives bid me farewell with a nudge. \u201cYou will come back after finishing school, right?\u201d they asked. \u201cTo develop your motherland,\u201d they joked, before adding more seriously: \u201cPlus, you will surely have a brighter future here.\u201d But when I saw them again after returning, many seem puzzled. \u201cWhy did you come back?\u201d they ask. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you find a way to stay?\u201d Chinese are leaving their country in droves. Students, entrepreneurs, bureaucrats, celebrities, pregnant mothers \u2014 it seems everyone is trying to get away. They land on the campuses of New England universities, in Silicon Valley offices and Manhattan condos, in hospital beds in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Those who stay grumble about the exodus while speaking of the United States in rapt fascination. \u201cI hear Americans can go to hospitals for free. The health care system covers it all!\u201d \u201cEverybody in America can get a job, even without a college degree. Isn\u2019t that the case?\u201d A friend burdened with debt to buy an apartment outside Beijing\u2019s Fifth Ring Road described the better fortune of her cousin in Virginia and sighed. \u201cShe bought a house just four years after graduating from college, and she\u2019s only a middle-school teacher!\u201d If I spoke of the United States this way, friends would glare in offense. I now tread carefully, avoiding out-of-context comments about China or the United States that might upset people. But sometimes, when confronted with rosy depictions of life in the United States, I can\u2019t help but trying to present a more nuanced picture. If my American friends inundated me with questions about China, though, my Chinese friends are usually less curious about the subtleties of life in the United States. When I try to explain the problems with American health insurance or school testing, their eyes begin to wander. After telling my friend with the cousin in Virginia about property taxes, she replied, \u201cWhat do I need to know that for. In China, you can\u2019t even afford the down payment!\u201d I gradually realized what was happening. Like someone gazing out a window but staring only at his own reflection, many Chinese look at America in ways that are colored by their feelings toward China. The United States they see \u2014 a nation with a pristine environment, perfect schools, generous welfare and complete political transparency \u2014 is a figment of their imagination, custom-made in stark contrast to the reality we live in. This is what makes my comments about China or the United States so grating for them: The same hopes and anxieties for China that lay behind their idealized notions of America also heightened their sensitivity to criticism of China from outsiders. And that is how they saw me. The years I spent in the United States, it seems, had served only to deepen the sting of my words. I once joined old friends at a high school reunion in mocking President Xi Jinping\u2019s flashy campaign to curtail government waste. My opinions echoed theirs, but one classmate quickly turned on me. \u201cIn America, of course you don\u2019t need this. But this is China. This is how things have to start,\u201d he said, though a few minutes earlier he had derided the campaign as \u201ca big show\u201d staged by the authorities. I stayed silent the rest of the meal. Before it ended, the classmate approached with a question. \u201cI heard about something,\u201d he said. \u201cI heard you can buy a large house in a nice suburb on the East Coast for just $200,000. Is that true?\u201d Not long ago, Grandma showed me an essay she wrote in 1984. The piece reminisced about her days at The Hunan Daily, the newspaper where she started her journalistic career in the 1950s. Then a bright-eyed, plucky girl in her early 20s, she was assigned to report on the \u201cnew scenes of rural prosperity since the Great Liberalization.\u201d For three years, she roamed the province, visiting ethnic minority villages tucked in the mountains and interviewing veterans who had fought against the invading Japanese forces. The headline was in bold: \u201cI Was the Rough Country Girl.\u201d I suggested to Grandma that she put more of her remembrances in writing. But she demurred, complaining that Mao-era bureaucratese clogged her pen the moment it touched paper. She said her dark memories of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution would not find an audience in today\u2019s China. I assured her that I was eager to read about them. I told her my friends in America would be too. Perhaps I could translate her writing into English\u2026 Her face sank at the suggestion. \u201cWhy should I be writing for foreigners? What could they possibly understand? I can\u2019t believe you even proposed that!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d I blurted out. A wave of words rolled in my chest and tumbled to the tip of my tongue. I looked at Grandma. The corner of her mouth twitched. Deep furrows lined her forehead. I held my tongue.", "published": "Mon, 20 Jan 2014 03:15:47 GMT", "tags": ["United States", "Newspapers", "Careers and Professions", "Education (K-12)", "Censorship"], "title": "Sinosphere Blog: Back in China, Watching My Words", "updated": "Mon, 20 Jan 2014 03:15:47 GMT", "author": "By HELEN GAO", "url": "http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/back-in-china-watching-ones-words/?partner=rss&emc=rss", "_id": 164698088, "html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content\"><div class=\"w592\"><img src=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/01/19/world/19sino-gao/19sino-gao-tmagArticle.jpg\" id=\"100000002659036\" alt=\"Chinese tourists taking in the sights in New York.

Although some villagers are still consumed by grief and hatred, economic necessity \u2014 and for some, a desire to return home \u2014 is paving the way to reconciliation, which is likely to be long and fraught with challenges. A 39-year-old doctor, Arvind Kumar, is leading the initiative for the Hindus from the village of Fugana, where two Muslims were killed and six Muslim women allegedly gang-raped on Sept. 8. A week earlier, riots broke out in the sugarcane districts of Muzaffarnagar and Shamli after two Hindu men and a Muslim were killed, the reason for which remains unclear. Muslims, who make up about 25 percent of the 7,000 villagers of Fugana, say that they had lived peacefully with their Hindu neighbors until the Hindus attacked them on Sept. 8. Many Muslims ran through the sugarcane fields to the neighboring village of Jogiya Khera, where they are now staying. Last week, as the winter sun set, Mr. Kumar sat in his family home and talked animatedly about the harmony that had always existed in Fugana. The doctor, who belongs to the landowning Jat community, said that he had helped organize three meetings since December to find ways of restoring trust between the two sides. Mr. Kumar was not disheartened by the absence of the Muslims of Fugana from these meetings, who sent leaders of other villages to represent them. \u201cThis is only the beginning, but I am hopeful that we can heal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be bad for everyone if we get stuck in the past.\u201d In the most recent meeting, on Jan. 7, at the Jat village of Karoda Mahajan, about two kilometers (a little over a mile) from Fugana, both sides talked about the conditions under which the Muslims could return to their villages. Mr. Kumar said 25 of the Jats and about 20 representatives for the Muslims were at the meeting. The head of the state government\u2019s sugarcane directorate, Virendra Singh, who attended the meeting in a private capacity as the third-party observer, said persuading Muslims to come home would be complicated and would take time. Betwa Sharma Hajiman Ali, 55, at Jogiya Khera village on Jan 8. He refuses to return to his village in Fugana. One problem, for instance, is that the state government compensation of 500,000 rupees, or $8,100, was given to people from the nine worst-hit villages in the Muzaffarnagar district on the condition that they would not return home, a rule that was intended to discourage false damage claims. Mr. Singh is recommending that the government lift this condition, but he stressed that before addressing these bigger challenges, the talks should just focus on getting Muslims and Hindus interacting with each other again. \u201cWe have to create the right atmosphere for making the hearts of people meet again,\u201d he said. So at the last meeting, the Muslims\u2019 representatives and the Jats agreed that the Jats villagers would guarantee the safety of those who return to Fugana and defer payment of their debts. Mr. Singh described the atmosphere at the meeting as constructive, considering the animosity in the community in the aftermath of the riots. Muslims were also assured that they would not be pressured to drop police complaints as a condition for future reconciliation, a fear that has made the Muslims from Fugana wary of joining the talks directly. Naseem Ahmed, leader of the Muslims in Fugana village, said that he was receptive to joining the talks if the Jats made no attempts to subvert the course of justice. But Mr. Ahmed, who is living in Jogiya Khera, conceded that innocent people had mistakenly implicated in the aftermath of the riot and that those complaints should be voluntarily withdrawn. \u201cWe only want the guilty to be punished,\u201d he said. Mr. Ahmed said confusion led to the misidentification of suspects; Jat villagers said their accusers are those who owe them money. In the entire village of Fugana, Mr. Kumar said, the most complaints were filed against him \u2013 he faced 39 charges, for murder, looting and arson. The doctor said all the complaints are false. On the contrary, he said, he had the most Muslim friends and acquaintances in the village because they all came to his clinic for medicine. On Monday, Mr. Kumar was relieved to hear that the person who had accused him of murder had withdrawn his complaint. And more support came from an unexpected source, Mr. Ahmed, who said the doctor was the one of the Jats who had warned Muslims that trouble was brewing before the attacks on Sept. 8. Mr. Ahmed also said that some Jat neighbors, including a milkman and a retired college professor, had risked their own lives trying to protect Muslims that day, and that another Jat villager even took a bullet for it. But Hajiman Ali, 55, who made frantic calls for six hours before help arrived, said that he would not go back to Fugana, where his family was attacked by a Hindu mob armed with swords and rifles. From his hiding spot on a roof, Mr. Ali said that he could see his injured son lying on the ground and bleeding. He would find out later that his daughter-in-law had been gang-raped in their home. \u201cHow can I ever forgive?\u201d he asked. Local observers said the charges of rape could be the biggest obstacle to a truce. Six Muslim women from Fugana took the bold step of registering complaints of gang rape despite the risk of being shamed in the community. So far, none of the men named in the complaint have been arrested, angering the Muslims. Hari Narayan Singh, a senior police official in Muzaffarnagar, said Tuesday that all six cases were still under investigation. Meanwhile, the human rights lawyer Vrinda Grover said she has filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court because it seems impossible for the rape victims to get justice in the politicized aftermath of the riots. \u201cThe police are not doing anything,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is much greater bias and hostility in the system.\u201d The Jats deny that any rapes occurred in their village. \u201cThere was no rape,\u201d said Pushpendar Malik, a 40-year-old Jat, who has been accused of rape. \u201cIt would be like raping your daughter or sister.\u201d A widow from Fugana, who now lives in Jogiya Khera, said that she was raped by four men in the cattle shed of her home. The 45-year-old woman recognized them as the men in whose fields she worked as a laborer. \u201cI kept saying that I was their mother\u2019s age, but they made fun of me and called me their wife,\u201d she said. (Under Indian law, rape victims cannot be identified.) Her home in Fugana now stands empty and silent on a red brick lane, which is lined with other homes abandoned by Muslims. Remnants of their lives were strewn around dusty courtyards. In the widow\u2019s house, clothes, slippers and photographs littered a dark room. Cakes of cow dung lay cracked and crumbling in the cattle shed. In a larger house, not far from the red brick lane, Mr. Kumar said that Jats in the village had been on tenterhooks about getting arrested until November. He said that when the police had tried to enter their village to make arrests, Jats had run them out by throwing stones. \u201cEveryone slept on the roof to keep vigil at all times to see if anyone was coming, but now the situation is calmer,\u201d he said. The Special Investigation Team formed by the state government is looking into 571 criminal cases involving more than 6,000 suspects, according to local media reports. So far, the team has dismissed 60 cases and initiated proceedings against 300. With Hindu Jats warning that even more violence may erupt if innocent villagers are arrested, Mr. Kumar said that both the community and the state government have a stake in the village-level talks being successful. Soon though, necessity may provide the strongest push for reconciliation. The physical separation of Hindus and Muslims has wrecked the balance of these interdependent societies, and its economic toll increases every day. While Muslims have no jobs, Jats suddenly find themselves without farmhands, builders, painters, carpenters and washermen. Mr. Ahmed, the Muslim leader, said that unemployed Muslims are now feeling so bored and frustrated that they would seriously consider going back to work if they could feel safe around Jats. \u201cSo many in their hearts want to go back to their homes and their old friends,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they must also get justice and feel safe.\u201d The next meeting, Mr. Kumar said, is likely to be held this month in the Muslim village of Loi, and Mr. Ahmed said that he would consider attending this time.", "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 08:05:28 GMT", "tags": ["Demonstrations, Protests, and Riots", "Uttar Pradesh State (India)", "Muzaffarnagar (India)", "Muslims and Islam", "Sex Crimes", "Supreme Court of India", "Hinduism"], "title": "India Ink: A Village Takes Small Steps Toward Reconciliation After Muzaffarnagar Riots", "updated": "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 08:05:28 GMT", "author": "By BETWA SHARMA", "url": "http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/16/a-village-takes-small-steps-toward-reconciliation-after-muzaffarnagar-riots/?partner=rss&emc=rss", "_id": 169616874, "html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content\"><div class=\"w480\"><img src=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/01/15/world/asia/15-house-IndiaInk/15-house-IndiaInk-blog480.jpg\" id=\"100000002651640\" alt=\"The courtyard of the abandoned home of a 45-year-old rape victim in Fugana in Muzaffarnagar district of Uttar Pradesh, on Jan. 8\"/><span class=\"credit\">Betwa Sharma</span> <span class=\"caption\">The courtyard of the abandoned home of a 45-year-old rape victim in Fugana in Muzaffarnagar district of Uttar Pradesh, on Jan. 8</span></div>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">FUGANA, Uttar Pradesh\u2013 Four months after religious violence shattered generations of coexistence in the rural hinterland of Uttar Pradesh, community leaders are trying to get Hindus and Muslims to talk to each other again as the first step to removing the fear and bitterness that divides villages in the Muzaffarnagar district.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">Although some villagers are still consumed by grief and hatred, economic necessity \u2014 and for some, a desire to return home \u2014 is paving the way to reconciliation, which is likely to be long and fraught with challenges.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">A 39-year-old doctor, Arvind Kumar, is leading the initiative for the Hindus from the village of Fugana, where two Muslims were killed and six Muslim women allegedly gang-raped on Sept. 8.

Iranian president Hassan Rouhani, center, listens to a session of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. (Denis Balibouse/Reuters)The United States won a short-term diplomatic victory over Iran this week. Under intense pressure from American officials, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon withdrew an invitation for Iranian officials to attend the Syria peace conference. Disinviting Tehran is the latest example of the Obama administration\u2019s continual search for easy, risk-free solutions in Syria. As the conflict destabilizes the region, however, Washington must finally face the hard choice: Either compromise with Iran, or decisively support and arm the rebels. The lack of an Iranian presence in Switzerland this week dooms the talks\u2019 prospects. Whether Tehran\u2019s actions are depraved or not, its comprehensive efforts to supply troops, munitions, and funding to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad makes the Iranian government the key foreign player in the conflict. \u201cIran is the sine qua non of the solution,\u201d said an American analyst, who closely follows Syria and spoke on condition of anonymity. \u201cThey have to feel comfortable with the outcome\u2014if there is going to be a solution.\u201d Washington must finally face the hard choice: Either compromise with Iran, or decisively support and arm the rebels.As fighting enters its third year, the dynamics in Syria increasingly resemble those of Afghanistan in the 1980s. During the Cold War, the United States, the Soviet Union, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan each backed various factions in Afghanistan for its own gain. The result? Thirty years of proxy war that killed an estimated 1 million Afghans and created one of the world\u2019s most impoverished, fragmented, and radicalized societies. U.S. and other Western officials express legitimate frustration with the fractious nature of Syria\u2019s opposition. But in Syria today, a version of Afghanistan-style war-by-foreign proxy is dividing the opposition and prolonging the conflict. Iran and Saudi Arabia, like the United States and the Soviet Union before them, are locked in an existential struggle\u2014their own Cold War, over influence in the region\u2014which is inflaming Shia-Sunni tensions. An opportunistic Russia, meanwhile, is using Syria\u2019s dissolution to extend its influence in the region as well. Though the Obama administration talks as if it is a central player in Syria, it is, largely, on the sidelines. The United States, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar continue to back different, often opposing, rebel groups, with no coordinated strategy. As Iran and Assad act in lock-step, Washington and its regional allies squabble. \u201cThis has proved to be a huge distraction,\u201d a recent International Crisis Group report concluded, \u201cAt critical points, it has effectively ground coalition activity to a halt.\u201d The Syrian conflict\u2014like Afghanistan 30 years ago\u2014is spinning out of control, as each outside power pursues its own agenda. Sectarian and jihadi forces unleashed today will be difficult to rein in for years, if not decades. This week\u2019s peace conference will seem laughably quaint. We have seen this before. In 1982, Afghan, Pakistani, U.S., and Soviet negotiators gathered in Switzerland to try to end to the conflict in Afghanistan. Six years later, they signed the Geneva Accords, which resulted in the withdrawal of all Soviet forces from Afghanistan the next year. But the forces that the United States and its allies had released\u2014radicalism, sectarianism, tribalism, and lawlessness\u2014devoured Afghanistan in the 1990s. Thirty years later, those centrifugal forces still haunt that fractured nation. This week\u2019s negotiations are laudable. U.S. officials hope they will lead to temporary ceasefires, aid deliveries, and prisoner exchanges. They also assert that the talks might lead some members of Assad\u2019s inner circle to defect. The conference\u2019s first day, though, produced only vitriolic exchanges between the Syrian government and opposition. The historic Khalid bin al-Walid Mosque, damaged by years of fighting, in Homs, Syria. (Thaer Al Khalidiya/Reuters)There is a sharp disconnect between perceptions of the conflict inside the United States and within the region. Though the White House and the U.S. public are understandably hesitant about arming Syria\u2019s rebels or carrying out air strikes, countries and groups in the region see the conflict as pivotal. From minority Alawites, who fear a takeover of Syria by Sunni jihadists, to the governments of Iran and Saudi Arabia, the parties in the region see the struggle as a direct threat to their existence. Syrian officials are growing confident that they are winning. They cite recent infighting among rebel groups as evidence that the opposition is imploding. Despite Washington\u2019s calls for Assad\u2019s ouster, it remains clear that the Obama White House will not use military force. Saudi officials are so angered by the Obama administration\u2019s unwillingness to arm the rebels that they have \u201cgone rogue.\u201dSince the United States struck an accord with Russia to remove Syria\u2019s chemical weapons in September, the regime\u2019s brutality has expanded exponentially, according to human rights groups. The Assad government has increased its use of starvation siege tactics. It is demolishing more civilian neighborhoods with makeshift \u201cbarrel bombs.\u201d And a new trove of chilling photographs, if verified, documents the torture and killing of as many as 11,000 detainees. On the other side of the conflict, Saudi officials are so angered by the Obama administration\u2019s unwillingness to arm the rebels that they have \u201cgone rogue,\u201d according to the American analyst who asked not to be named. Convinced that Washington will not confront Iran in Syria, Saudi officials are stepping up their efforts to arm Sunni jihadists. \u201cThey feel like they played nice and they lost strategically for it,\u201d said the analyst. \u201cThe problem with that is that the Saudis don\u2019t have a very good track record at controlling the entities that they create.\u201d The analyst was, of course, referring to Afghanistan, where the United States and Saudi Arabia armed and trained anti-Soviet jihadists\u2014including a young Saudi fighter named Osama bin Laden. The unintended consequences continue to be felt today. Unless Iran is negotiated with or confronted militarily in Syria, the Geneva talks of 2014 are likely to be as insignificant as those of 1988. Yes, the Assad government is engaging in unspeakable brutality. Hard-line jihadists in the opposition are also carrying out horrific acts. But foreign powers are exacerbating this conflict by pursuing their own rivalries in the region. All that has changed is that the hundreds dying each week are Syrians, not Afghans.

During the Cold War, the United States, the Soviet Union, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan each backed various factions in Afghanistan for its own gain. The result? Thirty years of proxy war that killed an estimated 1 million Afghans and created one of the world\u2019s most impoverished, fragmented, and radicalized societies.</p>\n\n<p>U.S. and other Western officials express legitimate frustration with the fractious nature of Syria\u2019s opposition. But in Syria today, a version of Afghanistan-style war-by-foreign proxy is dividing the opposition and prolonging the conflict.</p>\n\n<p>Iran and Saudi Arabia, like the United States and the Soviet Union before them, are locked in an existential struggle\u2014their own Cold War, over influence in the region\u2014which is inflaming Shia-Sunni tensions. An opportunistic Russia, meanwhile, is using Syria\u2019s dissolution to extend its influence in the region as well.</p>\n\n<p>Though the Obama administration talks as if it is a central player in Syria, it is, largely, on the sidelines. The United States, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar continue to back different, often opposing, rebel groups, with no coordinated strategy. As Iran and Assad act in lock-step, Washington and its regional allies squabble.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThis has proved to be a huge distraction,\u201d a recent International Crisis Group\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/middle-east-north-africa/egypt-syria-lebanon/syria/146-anything-but-politics-the-state-of-syria-s-political-opposition.aspx\">report concluded</a>, \u201cAt critical points, it has effectively ground coalition activity to a halt.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The Syrian conflict\u2014like Afghanistan 30 years ago\u2014is spinning out of control, as each outside power pursues its own agenda. Sectarian and jihadi forces unleashed today will be difficult to rein in for years, if not decades. This week\u2019s peace conference will seem laughably quaint.</p>\n\n<p>We have seen this before. In 1982, Afghan, Pakistani, U.S., and Soviet negotiators gathered in Switzerland to try to end to the conflict in Afghanistan. Six years later, they signed the Geneva Accords, which resulted in the withdrawal of all Soviet forces from Afghanistan the next year.</p>\n\n<p>But the forces that the United States and its allies had released\u2014radicalism, sectarianism, tribalism, and lawlessness\u2014devoured Afghanistan in the 1990s. Thirty years later, those centrifugal forces still haunt that fractured nation.</p>\n\n<p>This week\u2019s negotiations are laudable. U.S. officials hope they will lead to temporary ceasefires, aid deliveries, and prisoner exchanges. They also assert that the talks might lead some members of Assad\u2019s inner circle to defect.

Ms. Heen is a founding partner at Triad Consulting Group and a lecturer on law at Harvard Law School, where she has taught negotiation since 1995. She wrote \u201cDifficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most\u201d (Penguin, 2000), with Douglas Stone and Bruce Patton. Ms. Heen and Mr. Stone have a book coming out in March called \u201cThanks for the Feedback: The Science and Art of Receiving Feedback Well (Even When It Is Off Base, Unfair, Poorly Delivered, and Frankly, You\u2019re Not in the Mood)\u201d (Viking, 2014). Her answers draw on insights and strategies from both books.Here is the fourth set of responses from Ms. Heen; Part 1 can be found here, Part 2 can be found here, and Part 3 can be found here. Final responses, focused on inheritance questions, will be posted on Jan. 22.Getting Through a WeddingQ. How can we get through a wedding where the mom and dad don\u2019t prefer to communicate with each other and the stepmother postures herself to be seen as an equal mother? \u2014 Suzanne Sheila Heen, an expert in negotiating conflicts. A. Rather than frame the question as \u201chow to get through a wedding where\u2026,\u201d you should probably think about it as \u201chow to get through a marriage where\u2026.\u201dA theologian said to me recently: \u201cPlanning a wedding is a microcosm of the marriage itself. All the things the couple is going to fight about or struggle with \u2013 money, disagreements, family dynamics \u2013 are at the heart of the wedding planning process.\u201d So while eloping is a tempting no-muss, no-fuss sidestepping of these issues, the core issues don\u2019t go away. They are often waiting for you in some form (though perhaps less intense) on the other side of the honeymoon.So why not take the wedding planning process \u2013 where your needs and desires are center stage anyway \u2013 as an opportunity to make some requests of your mom, dad and stepmom for how you will all handle these kinds of conflicts going forward? Particularly if you plan to have children, these folks may be crossing paths more often at births, birthdays, vacations and holidays. You and your spouse are going to need to establish expectations about how you will handle everyone\u2019s conflicting interests to have you present at holidays, to be the first to meet the new grandchild and so forth. And these trade-offs need to be made not just inside your side of the family, but also between your family and your spouse\u2019s family.So, decide what you and your fianc\u00e9 want in terms of the roles you would like your parents and stepparent to play in the wedding ceremony and reception. Then take the lead and sit down and talk with each of them privately. Say:\u00b7 You mean an enormous amount to me, and I\u2019m looking forward to your being a part of our lives as a couple and as a family for years to come.\u00b7 Here\u2019s the role(s) I\u2019d like you to play in the wedding, and why. If you\u2019re asking them to take what they perceive to be a lower-status role, acknowledge that: \u201cI know you\u2019d like to walk me down the aisle. I don\u2019t feel like that\u2019s fair to my mom, and it\u2019s a real dilemma for me. This is the best solution I\u2019ve come up with. But I don\u2019t want you to hear it as my loving you any less than I do.\u201d\u00b7 Look to meet their interests in other ways \u2013 ask your stepmom to do a reading or give a toast or something else that would mean something to her.\u00b7 Tell each of them: \u201cIt would mean a lot to me if you would make a special effort to make (mom/dad/stepmom) feel welcome. I love you all, you have all been important to me, and it\u2019s hard on me to see tension between you.\u201dFinally, remember that while we think of weddings as \u201cabout\u201d the bride and groom, they also function as a very public statement to all of your family and friends about how you feel about your parents and stepparents. So be empathetic to everyone\u2019s desire to feel publicly acknowledged and appreciated, even as you work to shape everyone\u2019s expectations for the future.Daughter Came OutQ. My daughter recently came out to our family as gay and invited everyone to a commitment reception/celebration. My husband\u2019s brother and his family refused to attend on the grounds that their religion didn\u2019t recognize homosexuality and their belief that homosexuals should remain celibate. My husband\u2019s parents who follow the same religion did attend out of a commitment to family. I have not been able to get over this hurtful action by my brother-in-law, niece and nephews and am having serious issues with the idea of ever interacting with them again and would welcome suggestions as to how to handle this conflict. \u2014 cdmA. Congratulations to your daughter, and to your husband\u2019s parents (her grandparents) for showing up, despite their reservations. In many ways, her grandparents epitomize what it means to be family: We show up for each other, even when the decisions others are making are puzzling and even troubling to us.Her grandparents also offer a model for how you can handle the situation with your brother-in-law. The choice he made \u2013 in not attending \u2013 is puzzling and troubling to you. But out of commitment to family, I want to encourage you to keep showing up.That is not to suggest that it is easy, I know. The very hardest thing for me to handle is seeing anyone hurt one of my children \u2013 it\u2019s 100 times worse than being hurt myself. That mama bear instinct to lash out and protect your child is a reflection of how much you love her. She is lucky to have you in her corner, especially as she navigates a world that isn\u2019t 100 percent supportive.What you don\u2019t say is how she felt about her uncle and family\u2019s no-show. She may have been deeply hurt, or she may have shrugged it off, recognizing that not everyone will be instantly accepting. In either event, what she needs from you is not for you to escalate the tension in the relationship. She needs your continuing support, and your efforts to create any opportunities you can over time to encourage positive contact.Your brother-in-law and his wife are in a difficult position and are trying to figure out how to navigate this just as much as you are. They don\u2019t have to support same-sex marriage to eventually meet (and perhaps grow to like) your daughter\u2019s partner as a person. Over time, they need to continue to be invited, and to meet your daughter\u2019s children if she and her partner have them. As your daughter and her cousins progress into adulthood, maximizing opportunities for them to stay in contact and spend time together will help prevent a rift that grows with generations. Your efforts (and hers) to reach out may be repeatedly rebuffed or met with silence. That\u2019s O.K. What won\u2019t help is to respond to your sense of judgment from them with judgment of them. That will cause everyone to retreat in hurt and anger.The Loud HusbandQ. How do I talk to my spouse about social mannerisms he has that make me (and others) uncomfortable. I have tried sharing how they make me feel, but this has not brought about any change. Examples include somewhat unusual table manners, being inappropriately loud, interrupting, and taking the opposite side, just for fun, in any discussion. \u2013 AnonA. Were these mannerisms in evidence when you were dating? If so, I bet they were charming, or at least well compensated for by his other positive attributes. Often the things we find quirky or entertaining when we\u2019re newly infatuated begin to rub raw and feel overbearing when that infatuation wears away and unconditional love is supposed to set in. You\u2019re not alone in feeling: \u201cI do love you \u2026 and I\u2019d love it if you would change.\u201d Welcome to marriage.One thing to do is to step back and remember the big picture: The positive attributes that you love about your spouse and the ways that these annoyances fit into the totality of who he is, for better and for worse. Everyone is a mixed bag, and this set of aggravations may be more manageable than some you could have ended up with (serial infidelity comes to mind). I\u2019m assuming that given the big picture, this isn\u2019t a deal-breaker, although I understand that it\u2019s frustrating and exasperating, especially since you\u2019ve talked to him and he hasn\u2019t changed.Four assumptions that are tempting, but probably don\u2019t hold true:1. He\u2019s behaving this way because he doesn\u2019t care about my feelings. We\u2019re not sure why his table manners are \u201cunusual\u201d or why he\u2019s not responding to your coaching. It could be that he disagrees with your assessment (\u201cMy table manners aren\u2019t that bad\u201d or \u201cI wasn\u2019t that loud\u201d) or doesn\u2019t feel it\u2019s a priority (\u201cIt\u2019s not that big a deal\u201d). Or he may find the same behavior normal or even appealing: His table manners and conversational style may reflect the social norms in his family or where he grew up. In some families you aren\u2019t going to get a word in edgewise unless you interrupt and talk over each other, and a spirited debate is fun, not frustrating. One commenter suggested that he may have a bit of shadow Asperger\u2019s going on, and that\u2019s possible too. Or he may just have little filter between his internal voice and his external voice, causing him to interrupt and blurt out what he\u2019s thinking because he\u2019s excited or engaged in the conversation. Whatever the cause, it sounds as if it\u2019s longstanding behavior and habitual, and probably not a result of a conscious choice to ignore your concerns.2. The problem is obvious. Interestingly, the behavior you are describing is squarely in a blind spot for him, so it\u2019s particularly hard for him to see and understand. He doesn\u2019t watch himself eat \u2013 his eyes are on the front of his head looking out, so the one person he can\u2019t see at the table is himself. And one of the things that is hard for all of us to hear is our own voice. There is a little part of the brain just behind each ear called the S.T.S., which is dedicated to processing language. It\u2019s very active as we listen to someone else speak. But when we speak, our S.T.S. turns off. This means that we don\u2019t listen to our own voices the same way we listen to everyone else. A University College London researcher, Sophie Scott, suspects this is because we are listening to our own thoughts as we try to figure out how to say what we mean. Whatever the cause, this phenomenon explains exchanges like this:\u201cStop yelling!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not yelling!\u201dIt also explains why hearing our own voice on a recording is such an unpleasant surprise. Theoretically we should hear ourselves speak every day of our lives, but in fact, neuroscience is starting to explain why the voice we are least familiar with is our own.This suggests that one thing your husband needs in order to understand your feedback is to hear himself (volume, tone) the way others do. These days that\u2019s comparatively easy in terms of the technology \u2013 just put your smartphone on the table and use a recording app, as some commenters suggested in last week\u2019s post about the workplace bully. The hitch here is that in some states (12, to be exact), it\u2019s illegal to record someone without their permission (which could subject you to possible criminal prosecution or civil suit). So particularly in a workplace scenario, you\u2019ll want to check to see if you live in what\u2019s called a two-party consent state (which actually means you need all parties to a conversation to consent, not just two) before recording anyone.Wherever you live, when it comes to recording your spouse you want to be doubly careful. You don\u2019t want him to feel ambushed, or as if you\u2019re running some kind of marital sting operation. You are simply trying to help him understand your concerns. Explain your purposes: \u201cSo I know I\u2019ve complained about you speaking loudly, or interrupting, and I\u2019ve had a hard time describing what I\u2019m talking about and why it upsets me. I wondered whether it might be helpful if I could capture some of what I find upsetting on tape sometime, just so you can understand what I mean.\u201d You might even share the research I\u2019ve described above about why everyone has a hard time hearing himself \u2013 that\u2019s normal. Then see if he is game to give you permission to record now and again when the behavior comes up. Some people will find this interesting. Others will find it strange or even somewhat threatening. If he reacts badly, by all means, let it lie.If he is willing to hear a couple of samples, then take your time. If it\u2019s till death do you part, then you have plenty of opportunity and there is no rush. And you don\u2019t need a long clip, just a couple of representative examples of what upsets you.Now the trickiest part: talking to him about it. Don\u2019t have the conversation in front of others, and don\u2019t have it when you\u2019re feeling frustrated with him. Wait until you remember what you like about him and when you both have time to have a real discussion.The key is not to frame the conversation as an accusation or an \u201cI told you so\u201d but instead as an effort to help him understand what you\u2019re talking about. \u201cThe short clips I recorded help explain what I mean. I have them here, and we can either listen to them together, or you can listen to them on your own and then talk about it.\u201dGive him space to listen on his own if he wants to. Remember that listening to a recording of yourself suddenly routes your own voice through your S.T.S., and it\u2019s uncomfortable to listen to how we actually sound, especially when we\u2019re not at our best on the recording itself.Your job is to help him hear what upsets you and why. It\u2019s not to persuade him that you\u2019re right to be upset \u2013 whether it\u2019s right or wrong, it is. His job is to decide what to make of the information and your feelings about it.3. Behavior is easy to change. It\u2019s easy to assume that it\u2019s easy for other people to change their behavior. But in fact, it\u2019s hard for all of us to change longstanding habits and ways of being, even something as straightforward and seemingly simple as table manners, because they are largely unconscious and habitual. So even if he understands the behavior and your feelings, he may feel as if he can\u2019t change, at least not without a lot of work. The expectation that once you mention it to him the problem should disappear probably isn\u2019t realistic (as much as we want it to be).4. In happy marriages, spouses never hurt, embarrass or upset each other. It\u2019s tempting to assume that in other people\u2019s marriages \u2013 happy marriages \u2013 the spouses never do things that are frustrating or hurtful or exasperating. But of course, as human beings we inevitably step on each other\u2019s toes, disagree about important issues and occasionally behave in ways we later regret. And in these moments, we don\u2019t just want to feel loved and accepted in spite of our flaws. There\u2019s a way in which we want our spouses to love us because of our flaws. Their willingness to embrace even these less lovely parts of ourselves makes us feel that our spouses and family \u201cget us\u201d in a way that few others do.So your job may be to figure out how to live with his behavior \u2013 improved or not - in the years to come with some degree of humor and tolerance. When he interrupts you, you can say, \u201cWait, hold up a minute, I\u2019m not finished. \u2026\u201d When more standard table manners really matter \u2013 your dinner at the White House, for example \u2013 you might make a special request that he pay particular attention. But the sooner you can find a place of acceptance, the better for both of you. I\u2019m guessing many of our readers can share ways they\u2019ve come to let go of the things about their own spouses that simply were not going to change \u2013 everyone in a long-term relationship has his own path for getting there.And finally, let others fend for themselves. It\u2019s not your job to regulate his impact on everyone else in the world. A few people may need help \u2013 the kids or your elderly aunt. But assume most are adults who can talk with him themselves if it bothers them. You don\u2019t need to be caught in the middle.Mom\u2019s CultQ. Over the past several years, my mother has become very involved with a religious organization that is labeled (correctly, in my opinion after observing the group) as a cult. It seems to bring her happiness and satisfaction, and thus far she has not given large amounts of money or made any dramatic life changes. However, I once accompanied her to their temple and was dismayed by the teachings. She is very proud of their new temple and wants me to go with her. I don\u2019t want to be hurtful, but I am increasingly concerned about the things this organization does \u2013 and I really don\u2019t want to go, in part because this time I might not be able to hold my tongue. I have politely demurred thus far, but my mother is so enthusiastic that she seems unable to imagine that someone else might not be. What is the best way to address this situation? -- elizabethA. Your mom is excited about what\u2019s happening at her temple. It\u2019s natural that she wants to share her excitement with you, and ideally, for you to share her excitement. If you shut down conversation about this important aspect of her life, you\u2019re also shutting her out and making the topic uncomfortably taboo.So the question is whether you can find a way to be a willing and curious listener because you\u2019re interested in her, not in the cult itself. Ask about what she finds satisfying and what the church or community provides for her. You don\u2019t need to agree or disagree, just to be interested in your mom\u2019s life and how she is feeling. I bet you\u2019ll learn things about her that you didn\u2019t know before. And you\u2019ll also keep the channels of communication open in case she does start thinking about making big changes that might worry you.And you may need to be clear about the impact on you when she pressures you to join her: \u201cMom, I\u2019m always interested to hear about your experiences, and how you are doing. When things turn to pushing me to come with you, though, I feel uncomfortable, because it\u2019s not something I\u2019m interested in doing. It didn\u2019t have the same effect on me when I attended, and when you push, I think it makes me reluctant to discuss at all, which is a shame since it\u2019s important to you.\u201dIf and when it feels important, you can also share your concerns about her involvement:\u201cI do have some concerns about the church, and also the effect on you (describe what worries you and why).\u201dDon\u2019t be surprised if she defends the group by explaining that you are misunderstanding them. However she reacts in the moment, voicing your concerns plants a seed that may or may not take root at some point in the future.And, if she starts thinking about big amounts of money or changes, you can add:\u201cMom, obviously at the end of the day, this is your decision. And I want you to know that I\u2019m concerned about this not because I want to stand in the way of something that\u2019s important to you, and not because I\u2019m worried about inheritance in any way. But because I want to help protect your ability to be financially secure long term (or add what concerns you have about it).\u201dYour goal isn\u2019t to change your mom\u2019s mind \u2013 she is the only one who can change her mind. It is to stay connected with her, and that means staying connected to what excites, worries, comforts or inspires her, even while you\u2019re clear that joining this group isn\u2019t for you. It won\u2019t be an easy line to walk, and I admire your commitment to finding some way to navigate the situation with your mom.Good luck!NEXT WEEK: Inheritance disputes.", "published": "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 12:00:01 GMT", "tags": ["Elder Care", "Inheritance and Estate Taxes", "Wills and Estates", "Baby Boomers", "Families and Family Life", "Emotions", "Anxiety and Stress"], "title": "Ask an Expert: Negotiating Conflicts, Part 4: Parents at a Wedding", "updated": "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 12:00:01 GMT", "author": "By THE NEW YORK TIMES", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/15/booming/negotiating-conflicts-part-4-parents-at-a-wedding.html?partner=rss&emc=rss", "_id": 182066615, "html": "<html><body><div><article id=\"story\" class=\"story theme-main\">\n\n    <header class=\"story-header\">\n                <div class=\"story-meta\">\n            <button class=\"button comments-button  theme-kicker\"/>            \n            <h1 itemprop=\"headline\" class=\"story-heading\">Negotiating Conflicts, Part 4: Parents at a Wedding</h1>\n\n                        \n        </div>\n    </header>\n\n    \n    \n\n    <div class=\"extended-byline no-thumb\">\n    <p class=\"byline-column\">\n                Ask an Expert            </p>\n    <p class=\"byline\">By                     <span itemprop=\"author creator\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Person\" itemid=\"\">\n                                    <span class=\"byline-author\" data-byline-name=\"The New York Times\" itemprop=\"name\">THE NEW YORK TIMES</span>\n                            </span>\n            </p>\n</div>\n\n            \n    <p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"171\" data-total-count=\"171\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"><em><a href=\"http://www.pon.harvard.edu/faculty/sheila-heen/\">Sheila Heen</a>, an expert in negotiation and difficult conversations, is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/02/booming/taking-questions-on-how-to-negotiate-family-conflict.html?ref=booming\">answering reader questions </a>about how to resolve disputes within families and in other parts of life. </em></p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"583\" data-total-count=\"754\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"><em>Ms. Heen is a founding partner at <a href=\"http://triadconsultinggroup.com/\">Triad Consulting Group</a> and a lecturer on law at Harvard Law School, where she has taught negotiation since 1995.

All the things the couple is going to fight about or struggle with \u2013 money, disagreements, family dynamics \u2013 are at the heart of the wedding planning process.\u201d So while eloping is a tempting no-muss, no-fuss sidestepping of these issues, the core issues don\u2019t go away. They are often waiting for you in some form (though perhaps less intense) on the other side of the honeymoon.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"726\" data-total-count=\"2543\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">So why not take the wedding planning process \u2013 where your needs and desires are center stage anyway \u2013 as an opportunity to make some requests of your mom, dad and stepmom for how you will all handle these kinds of conflicts going forward? Particularly if you plan to have children, these folks may be crossing paths more often at births, birthdays, vacations and holidays. You and your spouse are going to need to establish expectations about how you will handle everyone\u2019s conflicting interests to have you present at holidays, to be the first to meet the new grandchild and so forth. And these trade-offs need to be made not just inside your side of the family, but also between your family and your spouse\u2019s family.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"234\" data-total-count=\"2777\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">So, decide what you and your fianc\u00e9 want in terms of the roles you would like your parents and stepparent to play in the wedding ceremony and reception. Then take the lead and sit down and talk with each of them privately. Say:</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"150\" data-total-count=\"2927\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u00b7 You mean an enormous amount to me, and I\u2019m looking forward to your being a part of our lives as a couple and as a family for years to come.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"423\" data-total-count=\"3350\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u00b7 Here\u2019s the role(s) I\u2019d like you to play in the wedding, and why. If you\u2019re asking them to take what they perceive to be a lower-status role, acknowledge that: \u201cI know you\u2019d like to walk me down the aisle. I don\u2019t feel like that\u2019s fair to my mom, and it\u2019s a real dilemma for me. This is the best solution I\u2019ve come up with. But I don\u2019t want you to hear it as my loving you any less than I do.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"156\" data-total-count=\"3506\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u00b7 Look to meet their interests in other ways \u2013 ask your stepmom to do a reading or give a toast or something else that would mean something to her.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"235\" data-total-count=\"3741\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u00b7 Tell each of them: \u201cIt would mean a lot to me if you would make a special effort to make (mom/dad/stepmom) feel welcome.

So be empathetic to everyone\u2019s desire to feel publicly acknowledged and appreciated, even as you work to shape everyone\u2019s expectations for the future.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"17\" data-total-count=\"4133\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"><strong>Daughter Came Out</strong></p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"634\" data-total-count=\"4767\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"><em>Q.

My husband\u2019s brother and his family refused to attend on the grounds that their religion didn\u2019t recognize homosexuality and their belief that homosexuals should remain celibate. My husband\u2019s parents who follow the same religion did attend out of a commitment to family. I have not been able to get over this hurtful action by my brother-in-law, niece and nephews and am having serious issues with the idea of ever interacting with them again and would welcome suggestions as to how to handle this conflict. \u2014 cdm</em></p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"308\" data-total-count=\"5075\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"><strong>A.</strong> Congratulations to your daughter, and to your husband\u2019s parents (her grandparents) for showing up, despite their reservations. In many ways, her grandparents epitomize what it means to be family: We show up for each other, even when the decisions others are making are puzzling and even troubling to us.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"253\" data-total-count=\"5328\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Her grandparents also offer a model for how you can handle the situation with your brother-in-law. The choice he made \u2013 in not attending \u2013 is puzzling and troubling to you. But out of commitment to family, I want to encourage you to keep showing up.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"393\" data-total-count=\"5721\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">That is not to suggest that it is easy, I know. The very hardest thing for me to handle is seeing anyone hurt one of my children \u2013 it\u2019s 100 times worse than being hurt myself. That mama bear instinct to lash out and protect your child is a reflection of how much you love her. She is lucky to have you in her corner, especially as she navigates a world that isn\u2019t 100 percent supportive.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"429\" data-total-count=\"6150\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">What you don\u2019t say is how <em>she</em> felt about her uncle and family\u2019s no-show. She may have been deeply hurt, or she may have shrugged it off, recognizing that not everyone will be instantly accepting. In either event, what she needs from you is not for you to escalate the tension in the relationship. She needs your continuing support, and your efforts to create any opportunities you can over time to encourage positive contact.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"822\" data-total-count=\"6972\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Your brother-in-law and his wife are in a difficult position and are trying to figure out how to navigate this just as much as you are. They don\u2019t have to support same-sex marriage to eventually meet (and perhaps grow to like) your daughter\u2019s partner as a person. Over time, they need to continue to be invited, and to meet your daughter\u2019s children if she and her partner have them. As your daughter and her cousins progress into adulthood, maximizing opportunities for them to stay in contact and spend time together will help prevent a rift that grows with generations. Your efforts (and hers) to reach out may be repeatedly rebuffed or met with silence. That\u2019s O.K. What won\u2019t help is to respond to your sense of judgment <em>from</em> them with judgment <em>of </em>them.

How do I talk to my spouse about social mannerisms he has that make me (and others) uncomfortable. I have tried sharing how they make me feel, but this has not brought about any change. Examples include somewhat unusual table manners, being inappropriately loud, interrupting, and taking the opposite side, just for fun, in any discussion. </em>\u2013 <em>Anon</em></p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"468\" data-total-count=\"7807\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"><strong>A</strong>. Were these mannerisms in evidence when you were dating? If so, I bet they were charming, or at least well compensated for by his other positive attributes. Often the things we find quirky or entertaining when we\u2019re newly infatuated begin to rub raw and feel overbearing when that infatuation wears away and unconditional love is supposed to set in. You\u2019re not alone in feeling: \u201cI <em>do</em> love you \u2026 and I\u2019d love it if you would change.\u201d Welcome to marriage.</p><p class=\"ad ad-placeholder\"/><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"566\" data-total-count=\"8373\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">One thing to do is to step back and remember the big picture: The positive attributes that you love about your spouse and the ways that these annoyances fit into the totality of who he is, for better and for worse. Everyone is a mixed bag, and this set of aggravations may be more manageable than some you could have ended up with (serial infidelity comes to mind). I\u2019m assuming that given the big picture, this isn\u2019t a deal-breaker, although I understand that it\u2019s frustrating and exasperating, especially since you\u2019ve talked to him and he hasn\u2019t changed.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"67\" data-total-count=\"8440\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Four assumptions that are tempting, but probably don\u2019t hold true:</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"1153\" data-total-count=\"9593\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">1. <strong>He\u2019s behaving this way because he doesn\u2019t care about my feelings.</strong> We\u2019re not sure why his table manners are \u201cunusual\u201d or why he\u2019s not responding to your coaching. It could be that he disagrees with your assessment (\u201cMy table manners aren\u2019t that bad\u201d or \u201cI wasn\u2019t that loud\u201d) or doesn\u2019t feel it\u2019s a priority (\u201cIt\u2019s not that big a deal\u201d). Or he may find the same behavior normal or even appealing: His table manners and conversational style may reflect the social norms in his family or where he grew up. In some families you aren\u2019t going to get a word in edgewise unless you interrupt and talk over each other, and a spirited debate is fun, not frustrating. One commenter suggested that he may have a bit of shadow Asperger\u2019s going on, and that\u2019s possible too. Or he may just have little filter between his internal voice and his external voice, causing him to interrupt and blurt out what he\u2019s thinking because he\u2019s excited or engaged in the conversation. Whatever the cause, it sounds as if it\u2019s longstanding behavior and habitual, and probably not a result of a conscious choice to ignore your concerns.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"927\" data-total-count=\"10520\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">2. <strong>The problem is obvious</strong>. Interestingly, the behavior you are describing is squarely in a blind spot for him, so it\u2019s particularly hard for him to see and understand. He doesn\u2019t watch himself eat \u2013 his eyes are on the front of his head looking out, so the one person he can\u2019t see at the table is himself. And one of the things that is hard for all of us to hear is our own voice. There is a little part of the brain just behind each ear called the S.T.S., which is dedicated to processing language. It\u2019s very active as we listen to someone else speak. But when we speak, our S.T.S. turns off. This means that we don\u2019t listen to our own voices the same way we listen to everyone else. A University College London researcher, Sophie Scott, suspects this is because we are listening to our own thoughts as we try to figure out how to say what we mean. Whatever the cause, this phenomenon explains exchanges like this:</p><aside class=\"marginalia comments-marginalia  comment-prompt-marginalia\" data-marginalia-type=\"sprinkled\"/><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"19\" data-total-count=\"10539\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u201cStop yelling!\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"24\" data-total-count=\"10563\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u201cI\u2019m not yelling!\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"260\" data-total-count=\"10823\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">It also explains why hearing our own voice on a recording is such an unpleasant surprise. Theoretically we should hear ourselves speak every day of our lives, but in fact, neuroscience is starting to explain why the voice we are least familiar with is our own.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"777\" data-total-count=\"11600\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">This suggests that one thing your husband needs in order to understand your feedback is to hear himself (volume, tone) the way others do. These days that\u2019s comparatively easy in terms of the technology \u2013 just put your smartphone on the table and use a recording app, as some commenters suggested in last week\u2019s post about the workplace bully. The hitch here is that in some states (12, to be exact), it\u2019s illegal to record someone without their permission (which could subject you to possible criminal prosecution or civil suit). So particularly in a workplace scenario, you\u2019ll want to check to see if you live in what\u2019s called a two-party consent state (which actually means you need <em>all</em> parties to a conversation to consent, not just two) before recording anyone.</p><p class=\"ad ad-placeholder\"/><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"954\" data-total-count=\"12554\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Wherever you live, when it comes to recording your spouse you want to be doubly careful. You don\u2019t want him to feel ambushed, or as if you\u2019re running some kind of marital sting operation. You are simply trying to help him understand your concerns. Explain your purposes: \u201cSo I know I\u2019ve complained about you speaking loudly, or interrupting, and I\u2019ve had a hard time describing what I\u2019m talking about and why it upsets me. I wondered whether it might be helpful if I could capture some of what I find upsetting on tape sometime, just so you can understand what I mean.\u201d You might even share the research I\u2019ve described above about why<em> everyone</em> has a hard time hearing himself \u2013 that\u2019s normal. Then see if he is game to give you permission to record now and again when the behavior comes up. Some people will find this interesting. Others will find it strange or even somewhat threatening. If he reacts badly, by all means, let it lie.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"253\" data-total-count=\"12807\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">If he is willing to hear a couple of samples, then take your time. If it\u2019s till death do you part, then you have plenty of opportunity and there is no rush. And you don\u2019t need a long clip, just a couple of representative examples of what upsets you.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"264\" data-total-count=\"13071\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Now the trickiest part: talking to him about it. Don\u2019t have the conversation in front of others, and don\u2019t have it when you\u2019re feeling frustrated with him. Wait until you remember what you like about him and when you both have time to have a real discussion.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"342\" data-total-count=\"13413\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The key is not to frame the conversation as an accusation or an \u201cI told you so\u201d but instead as an effort to help him understand what you\u2019re talking about. \u201cThe short clips I recorded help explain what I mean.

Remember that listening to a recording of yourself suddenly routes your own voice through your S.T.S., and it\u2019s uncomfortable to listen to how we actually sound, especially when we\u2019re not at our best on the recording itself.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"235\" data-total-count=\"13928\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Your job is to help him hear what upsets you and why. It\u2019s not to persuade him that you\u2019re right to be upset \u2013 whether it\u2019s right or wrong, it is. His job is to decide what to make of the information and your feelings about it.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"590\" data-total-count=\"14518\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">3. <strong>Behavior is easy to change.</strong> It\u2019s easy to assume that it\u2019s easy for other people to change their behavior. But in fact, it\u2019s hard for all of us to change longstanding habits and ways of being, even something as straightforward and seemingly simple as table manners, because they are largely unconscious and habitual. So even if he understands the behavior and your feelings, he may feel as if he can\u2019t change, at least not without a lot of work. The expectation that once you mention it to him the problem should disappear probably isn\u2019t realistic (as much as we want it to be).</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"716\" data-total-count=\"15234\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">4. <strong>In happy marriages, spouses never hurt, embarrass or upset each other.</strong> It\u2019s tempting to assume that in other people\u2019s marriages \u2013 happy marriages \u2013 the spouses never do things that are frustrating or hurtful or exasperating. But of course, as human beings we inevitably step on each other\u2019s toes, disagree about important issues and occasionally behave in ways we later regret. And in these moments, we don\u2019t just want to feel loved and accepted in spite of our flaws. There\u2019s a way in which we want our spouses to love us <em>because of</em> our flaws. Their willingness to embrace even these less lovely parts of ourselves makes us feel that our spouses and family \u201cget us\u201d in a way that few others do.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"709\" data-total-count=\"15943\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">So your job may be to figure out how to live with his behavior \u2013 improved or not - in the years to come with some degree of humor and tolerance. When he interrupts you, you can say, \u201cWait, hold up a minute, I\u2019m not finished. \u2026\u201d When more standard table manners really matter \u2013 your dinner at the White House, for example \u2013 you might make a special request that he pay particular attention. But the sooner you can find a place of acceptance, the better for both of you. I\u2019m guessing many of our readers can share ways they\u2019ve come to let go of the things about their own spouses that simply were not going to change \u2013 everyone in a long-term relationship has his own path for getting there.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"305\" data-total-count=\"16248\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">And finally, let others fend for themselves. It\u2019s not your job to regulate his impact on everyone else in the world. A few people may need help \u2013 the kids or your elderly aunt.

Over the past several years, my mother has become very involved with a religious organization that is labeled (correctly, in my opinion after observing the group) as a cult. It seems to bring her happiness and satisfaction, and thus far she has not given large amounts of money or made any dramatic life changes. However, I once accompanied her to their temple and was dismayed by the teachings. She is very proud of their new temple and wants me to go with her. I don\u2019t want to be hurtful, but I am increasingly concerned about the things this organization does \u2013 and I really don\u2019t want to go, in part because this time I might not be able to hold my tongue. I have politely demurred thus far, but my mother is so enthusiastic that she seems unable to imagine that someone else might not be. What is the best way to address this situation? </em><em>-- elizabeth</em></p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"316\" data-total-count=\"17439\" itemprop=\"articleBody\"><strong>A.</strong> Your mom is excited about what\u2019s happening at her temple. It\u2019s natural that she wants to share her excitement with you, and ideally, for you to share her excitement. If you shut down conversation about this important aspect of her life, you\u2019re also shutting her out and making the topic uncomfortably taboo.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"541\" data-total-count=\"17980\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">So the question is whether you can find a way to be a willing and curious listener because you\u2019re interested in her, not in the cult itself. Ask about what she finds satisfying and what the church or community provides for her. You don\u2019t need to agree or disagree, just to be interested in your mom\u2019s life and how she is feeling. I bet you\u2019ll learn things about her that you didn\u2019t know before. And you\u2019ll also keep the channels of communication open in case she does start thinking about making big changes that might worry you.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"485\" data-total-count=\"18465\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">And you may need to be clear about the impact on you when she pressures you to join her: \u201cMom, I\u2019m always interested to hear about your experiences, and how you are doing. When things turn to pushing me to come with you, though, I feel uncomfortable, because it\u2019s not something I\u2019m interested in doing. It didn\u2019t have the same effect on me when I attended, and when you push, I think it makes me reluctant to discuss at all, which is a shame since it\u2019s important to you.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"87\" data-total-count=\"18552\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">If and when it feels important, you can also share your concerns about her involvement:</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"111\" data-total-count=\"18663\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u201cI do have some concerns about the church, and also the effect on you (describe what worries you and why).\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"224\" data-total-count=\"18887\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Don\u2019t be surprised if she defends the group by explaining that you are misunderstanding them.

(Adam Century)BEIJING \u2014 At the Luding Bridge, the site of the single most celebrated event on China\u2019s Long March, I was the lone foreigner in a group of boisterous, chain-smoking government officials. They reeked of baijiu, a fiery grain alcohol, and hollered to each other so loudly that I couldn\u2019t hear the private tour guide. One of the cadres reached into a battle display to wrest a rifle out of the hands of an inanimate Red Army soldier. \u201cIt won\u2019t budge!\u201d he yelled. When I revealed that I was retracing the Long March by motorcycle, the men, who carried designer money pouches, shouted drunken reactions: \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not Chinese?\u201d cried a burly cadre in a sleek leather jacket. \u201cYou must really love Chairman Mao! We should make you a Party member!\u201d In 1934, an estimated 86,000 soldiers in the Communist Red Army decamped from their Soviet-style base in Jiangxi province in an attempt to escape from Chiang Kai-shek and his encircling Nationalist Army. The desperate retreat, which Mao Zedong later ingeniously labeled the \u201cLong March,\u201d lasted four trying seasons and crossed 11 provinces. Along the way, the marchers traversed snow-capped peaks in their bare feet and used dilapidated wooden rifles\u2014if they were armed at all\u2014to defend themselves against the Nationalists\u2019 machine guns and U.S.-supplied arsenal. I found evidence of a myth in decline: new, cavernous Long March museums devoid of visitors; memorials crumbling from neglect.Today, the Long March is the closest thing the People\u2019s Republic has to a national creation myth. It was during this trek that Mao solidified his position in the Communist Party leadership, and to this day, in a nod to symbolism, Chinese leaders often announce new policies from key sites along the famous route. For decades, the Long March has been a critical element of the Communist propaganda narrative, providing the Party with a veneer of ruggedness and frugality at a time when its top leaders have become a pampered elite. This summer, in an attempt to better understand the Long March\u2019s evolving legacy in contemporary China, I retraced the entire route by motorcycle, traveling from Jiangxi province to Yan\u2019an, the Shaanxi city that served as the Communist headquarters from 1936 to 1948. As I rode my motorcycle across the countryside, stopping at every village, city, and site associated with the march, I found evidence of a myth in decline: new, cavernous Long March museums devoid of visitors; memorials crumbling from neglect, weeds sprouting from their bases; and, most strikingly, the complete disengagement\u2014even disdain\u2014of China\u2019s youth. This disinterest comes in spite of massive propaganda efforts in recent years, and especially since President Xi Jinping took office a year ago, to promote the Communist values that the Long March embodies. Xi has proclaimed a \u201cChinese dream\u201d\u2014one of national strength and prosperity\u2014and he has visited key sites along the Long March to preach this message, often alluding to the Party\u2019s early \u201cglory days\u201d in order to convey a sense of Communist revival. But the Chinese people themselves seem to be forging their own dream\u2014marching ahead into the future as Mr. Xi reaches into the past. In early June, I began my journey in Ruijin, Jiangxi, the Communist power base throughout the early 1930s and the starting point of the Long March. With a population of roughly 600,000, Ruijin resembles the more than 2,000 other county-level cities in China. Motorcycle taxis lined People\u2019s Boulevard and hundreds of shopkeepers hawked everything from knock-off Nikes to sink faucets. But a short ride out of town revealed an alternate universe of Communist relics and monuments, including a multitude of Chairman Mao statues: fat Maos and thin ones; a buff Mao digging a well, and a young, handsome Mao speaking at a rally. I stopped counting at nine. My favorite discovery was a nearly 100-foot-tall sculpture of a Communist Party emblem\u2014a blazing red star with a globe bursting from the center\u2014in a large square across from a row of Chinese characters that read: \u201cMay the spirit of the Chinese Soviet forever shine bright.\u201d A five-minute walk from the city center, the square was empty when I visited on a warm Saturday afternoon. Well, mostly empty: I spotted a teenage couple that had chosen the site as a place to canoodle in secret. Adolescent dating is still frowned upon in China and prohibited in schools. The couple blushed and stared at the pavement as I walked by their shaded nook, somewhere between the characters meaning \u201cforever\u201d and \u201cshine.\u201d A deserted square in the former Communist Party power base of Ruijin with a monument to Chinese-Soviet solidarity (Adam Century)From Ruijin, I rode about 500 miles westward into Guangxi province, traveling past the factories of coastal Guangdong and the jagged mountain chains of southern Hunan province. For decades, Chinese history textbooks have insisted that the Long March covered 8,000 miles, but the figure, like many things in history, is more fable than fact\u2014it derives from a rough estimate made by Chairman Mao more than 70 years ago. (The actual figure is between 3,700 and 5,000 miles, and in total my trip covered just under 5,000 miles.) Only recently have historians\u2014both in China and abroad\u2014begun calling certain chapters of the march into question, bridging the chasm between the Party-bred legend and the historical truth. Many Chinese, for example, are still unaware that Mao spent the first several months of the Long March consigned to the Party\u2019s periphery, a punishment for having excessively cracked down on political opponents while in Jiangxi. But, in a stroke of luck, this demotion allowed him to escape culpability for one of the Red Army\u2019s most catastrophic defeats\u2014the Battle of the Xiang River, where the Communists were nearly thwarted by superior, U.S.-supplied Nationalist forces. A memorial dedicated to the battle, erected on the banks of the Xiang River in Guangxi, claims that 50,000 Red Army soldiers were \u201csacrificed\u201d; recent scholarship on the march suggests that at least half of them actually deserted. As the Red Army fled from the Xiang River deeper into China\u2019s interior, Mao connived behind the scenes (as he so often did), forging connections in preparation for an important meeting in Zunyi, where he masterfully orchestrated his own political rise. Today, museum exhibits in this area refer to Mao\u2019s increased prominence as the \u201cturning point\u201d of the Long March and, thus, the Chinese revolution. After traversing the mountains of Guizhou and Yunnan, I rode north toward the site of the Luding Bridge battle, where a small group of Red Army soldiers are said to have outfought a Nationalist brigade and three regiments, securing passage across the strategically important Dadu River. This was the signature event of the entire march: Under heavy enemy fire, Communist soldiers are alleged to have crawled across the bare iron chains of the ancient bridge, whose planks had been removed by the Nationalists. (What actually happened at Luding may have been far more mundane: Years later, Chinese leader and Long March veteran Deng Xiaoping reportedly told former U.S. National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski that, \u201cIn fact, it was a very easy military operation \u2026 but we felt we had to dramatize it.\u201d) *** One of the perks of Communist Party membership today is that the government sponsors educational field trips for its more than 85 million members, many of which involve visits to \u201cred tourism\u201d sites and are often followed by baijiu-filled banquets. After the inebriated cadres left the museum in Luding, slurred questions echoing behind them (\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re not Chinese?\u201d), the tour guide, a young woman named Yang Yi with dyed reddish hair, told me that roughly 90 percent of the museum\u2019s visitors are part of government field trips. \u201cThese visitors are almost all older men who have been forced to visit the museum to fulfill their Communist Party responsibilities. They never ask questions.\u201d Luding Bridge, the most celebrated site on China's Long March (Adam Century)At the summit of Liupan Mountain in the Ningxia region, where Mao is said to have coined the name \u201cLong March,\u201d I found a sprawling museum that was empty except for a 67-year-old military veteran and his adolescent granddaughter. Like most Chinese red tourism sites, the final exhibition room featured pictures of famous Party leaders visiting the venue. \u201cYou see these photos,\u201d the veteran told his granddaughter, \u201cthey prove that history is still important.\u201d Sporting earphones and absorbed with her smartphone, it was unclear whether she even heard him. Riding east, the scenery increasingly came to resemble the dry loess cliffs that are common in Yan\u2019an, the endpoint of the Long March. More than 30 million Chinese still live in caves that are dug into such cliffs. Throughout my journey, I boarded with local families or slept in discount rooms in village hotels, but as I approached Yan\u2019an, I took shelter in these cave-like dwellings. Reinforced with brick masonry and dug deep into the bases of mountains, the lodgings offered a respite from the summer sun. In Red Star Over China, the classic 1937 account of life in Yan\u2019an, U.S. journalist Edgar Snow remarked that the city\u2019s Red Army University \u201cwas probably the world\u2019s only seat of \u2018higher learning\u2019 whose classrooms were bombproof caves, with chairs and desks of stone and brick, and blackboards and walls of limestone and clay.\u201d Chinese often refer to Yan\u2019an as the \u201cRevolutionary Holy Land\u201d and some even described it to me as the \u201cJerusalem of the East.\u201d In spite of the hype, Yan\u2019an looked like the other Chinese cities that I passed through on my trip: a crowded downtown intersection featured KFCs and a Pizza Hut, and vehicles zigzagged to the tune of drill-work and car horns. The air was dusty, and the river, which once flowed through the city center, had been reduced to a dry creek bed. At the Date Garden, the Party\u2019s temporary headquarters when they reached Yan\u2019an in 1935, I came upon a group of several hundred Chinese soldiers on a Party field trip, a handful of whom were solemnly pledging allegiance to the Communist Party, a requisite ritual to gain Party membership. The pledge begins with unremarkable promises to \u201cServe the Chinese people,\u201d but then escalates to vows like \u201cNever reveal the Party\u2019s secrets.\u201d Soldiers shooed me away as the new Communist devotees made their final promise: \u201cNever betray the Party.\u201d *** Among the Chinese people whom I met on the road, my Long March project usually elicited one of two responses, depending on age. Older people tended to express admiration for my trip. For many of them, the journey was so entwined with the nationalist propaganda of their upbringings that they automatically interpreted my trip as a form of heroism. They lauded my \u201cpatriotic spirit\u201d and sometimes even offered to treat me to dinner. I initially objected to being mistaken for a Mao fanatic, but soon learned to be quiet and enjoy the free food. I initially objected to being mistaken for a Mao fanatic, but soon learned to be quiet and enjoy the free food.Young people, on the other hand, seemed baffled by my desire to investigate the Long March. \u201cWhy would you ever want to retrace the Long March?\u201d Wang Zengfeng, a college student whom I met in western Sichuan, asked me. \u201cDon\u2019t you have better things to do with your time?\u201d For Wang and his peers, members of the post-1980s generation that came of age under the influence of the Internet and Hollywood blockbusters, life has been about forging new roads\u2014 finding a privileged seat on China\u2019s breakneck economic bandwagon. A bike repair shop in Sichuan province (Adam Century)In early December, months after I completed my journey, China Newsweek, a popular Chinese-language weekly magazine, published a three-page expose on me entitled \u201cAn American\u2019s Chinese \u2018Long March.\u2019\u201d I was struck by how open and candid the journalist was during our interview\u2014we discussed many of the more controversial chapters of the march, as well as Mao\u2019s legacy, which is being reexamined in the aftermath of the 120th anniversary of the chairman\u2019s birth on December 26, 2013. But the final piece was sterile and uncritical of the Communist Party\u2019s account, passing me off as a Mao enthusiast. At one point, the author even compared me to Norman Bethune, the Canadian doctor who treated Mao Zedong in the 1930s and died on the battlefield, sacrificing himself, according to Chinese Party histories, \u201cfor the Communist revolution.\u201d The day that the China Newsweek article came out, I stopped at a newsstand near my house to pick up a copy. Right after I located the piece\u2014which featured a full-page picture of me on my motorcycle\u2014I heard the young vendor ask, \u201cIs that really you?\u201d I looked up and nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re really weird,\u201d he chuckled, and shook his head. \u201cEven us Chinese don\u2019t believe that stuff.\u201d", "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2014 17:27:29 GMT", "tags": ["International"], "title": "Motorcycle Diaries: Retracing Mao Zedong\u2019s Long March by Bike", "updated": "Fri, 10 Jan 2014 17:27:29 GMT", "author": "Adam Century", "url": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AtlanticInternational/~3/yr7Rox_39BY/story01.htm", "_id": 183901765, "html": "<html><body><div><p class=\"dek\">\n            Drunk officials, texting teens, and the decline of China\u2019s creation myth        </p>\n    \n    <div class=\"article-content\">\n\n                \n                \n        <figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/01/BikeLongMarch/bb6d5bc2b.jpg\"/><figcaption class=\"caption\">Adam's bike rests on a mountain in China's Guizhou province.

Xi has <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21577063-chinas-new-leader-has-been-quick-consolidate-his-power-what-does-he-now-want-his\">proclaimed</a> a \u201cChinese dream\u201d\u2014one of national strength and prosperity\u2014and he has <a href=\"http://news.163.com/13/0713/03/93KOUOPI00014Q4P.html\">visited</a> key sites along the Long March to preach this message, often alluding to the Party\u2019s early <a href=\"http://zjnews.zjol.com.cn/05zjnews/system/2006/10/23/007940894.shtml\">\u201cglory days\u201d</a> in order to convey a sense of Communist revival.</p>\n\n<p>But the Chinese people themselves seem to be forging their own dream\u2014marching ahead into the future as Mr. Xi reaches into the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In early June, I began my journey in Ruijin, Jiangxi, the Communist power base throughout the early 1930s and the starting point of the Long March. With a population of roughly 600,000, Ruijin resembles the more than 2,000 other county-level cities in China. Motorcycle taxis lined People\u2019s Boulevard and hundreds of shopkeepers hawked everything from knock-off Nikes to sink faucets.</p>\n\n<p>But a short ride out of town revealed an alternate universe of Communist relics and monuments, including a multitude of Chairman Mao statues: fat Maos and thin ones; a buff Mao digging a well, and a young, handsome Mao speaking at a rally. I stopped counting at nine.</p>\n\n<p>My favorite discovery was a nearly 100-foot-tall sculpture of a Communist Party emblem\u2014a blazing red star with a globe bursting from the center\u2014in a large square across from a row of Chinese characters that read: \u201cMay the spirit of the Chinese Soviet forever shine bright.\u201d A five-minute walk from the city center, the square was empty when I visited on a warm Saturday afternoon.</p>\n\n<p>Well, mostly empty: I spotted a teenage couple that had chosen the site as a place to canoodle in secret. Adolescent dating is still frowned upon in China and prohibited in schools. The couple blushed and stared at the pavement as I walked by their shaded nook, somewhere between the characters meaning \u201cforever\u201d and \u201cshine.\u201d</p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/01/SovietLongMarch/0d009e246.jpg\"/><figcaption class=\"caption\">A deserted square in the former Communist Party power base of Ruijin with a monument to Chinese-Soviet solidarity (Adam Century)</figcaption></figure><p>From Ruijin, I rode about 500 miles westward into Guangxi province, traveling past the factories of coastal Guangdong and the jagged mountain chains of southern Hunan province. For decades, Chinese history textbooks have insisted that the Long March <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20070311102040/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/04/03/wmao03.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2006/04/03/ixworld.html\">covered</a> 8,000 miles, but the figure, like many things in history, is more fable than fact\u2014it derives from a rough estimate made by Chairman Mao more than 70 years ago. (The actual figure is between 3,700 and 5,000 miles, and in total my trip covered just under 5,000 miles.) Only recently have historians\u2014both in China and abroad\u2014begun calling certain chapters of the march into question, bridging the chasm between the Party-bred legend and the historical truth.</p>\n\n<p>Many Chinese, for example, are still unaware that Mao spent the first several months of the Long March consigned to the Party\u2019s periphery, a punishment for having excessively cracked down on political opponents while in Jiangxi. But, in a stroke of luck, this demotion allowed him to escape culpability for one of the Red Army\u2019s most catastrophic defeats\u2014the Battle of the Xiang River, where the Communists were nearly thwarted by superior, U.S.-supplied Nationalist forces. A memorial dedicated to the battle, erected on the banks of the Xiang River in Guangxi, claims that 50,000 Red Army soldiers were \u201csacrificed\u201d; recent <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Long-March-Communist-Founding/dp/B008SMGP6A\">scholarship</a> on the march suggests that at least half of them actually deserted.</p>\n\n<p>As the Red Army fled from the Xiang River deeper into China\u2019s interior, Mao connived behind the scenes (as he so often did), forging connections in preparation for an important meeting in Zunyi, where he masterfully orchestrated his own political rise. Today, museum exhibits in this area refer to Mao\u2019s increased prominence as the \u201cturning point\u201d of the Long March and, thus, the <a href=\"http://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/chinese-rev\">Chinese revolution</a>.</p>\n\n<p>After traversing the mountains of Guizhou and Yunnan, I rode north toward the site of the Luding Bridge battle, where a small group of Red Army soldiers are said to have outfought a Nationalist brigade and three regiments, securing passage across the strategically important Dadu River. This was the signature event of the entire march: Under heavy enemy fire, Communist soldiers are alleged to have crawled across the bare iron chains of the ancient bridge, whose planks had been removed by the Nationalists. (What actually happened at Luding may have been far more mundane: Years later, Chinese leader and Long March veteran Deng Xiaoping <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=-WZ3j4USEzgC&amp;pg=PT244&amp;lpg=PT244&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CIn+fact,+it+was+a+very+easy+military+operation+but+we+felt+we+had+to+dramatize+it.%E2%80%9D%29&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=23vV6bcVFk&amp;sig=w6un7MnN4zSexMiXORl6wKWdtc0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wh3QUoq5HMfFsATtw4CADA&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CIn%20fact%2C%20it%20was%20a%20very%20easy%20military%20operation%20but%20we%20felt%20we%20had%20to%20dramatize%20it.%E2%80%9D%29&amp;f=false\">reportedly told</a> former U.S. National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski that, \u201cIn fact, it was a very easy military operation \u2026 but we felt we had to dramatize it.\u201d)</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n\n<p>One of the perks of Communist Party membership today is that the government sponsors educational field trips for its more than 85 million <a href=\"http://english.cpc.people.com.cn/206972/206974/8305636.html\">members</a>, many of which involve visits to \u201cred tourism\u201d sites and are often followed by <em>baijiu-</em>filled banquets. After the inebriated cadres left the museum in Luding, slurred questions echoing behind them (\u201cAre you <em>sure</em> you\u2019re not Chinese?\u201d), the tour guide, a young woman named Yang Yi with dyed reddish hair, told me that roughly 90 percent of the museum\u2019s visitors are part of government field trips. \u201cThese visitors are almost all older men who have been forced to visit the museum to fulfill their Communist Party responsibilities. They never ask questions.\u201d</p>\n\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/01/LudingLongMarch/aeb054c14.jpg\"/><figcaption class=\"caption\">Luding Bridge, the most celebrated site on China's Long March (Adam Century)</figcaption></figure><p>At the summit of <a href=\"http://www.china.org.cn/travel/Ningxia/2012-06/13/content_25658213.htm\">Liupan Mountain</a> in the Ningxia region, where Mao is said to have coined the name \u201cLong March,\u201d I found a sprawling museum that was empty except for a 67-year-old military veteran and his adolescent granddaughter. Like most Chinese red tourism sites, the final exhibition room featured pictures of famous Party leaders visiting the venue. \u201cYou see these photos,\u201d the veteran told his granddaughter, \u201cthey prove that history is still important.\u201d Sporting earphones and absorbed with her smartphone, it was unclear whether she even heard him.</p>\n\n<p>Riding east, the scenery increasingly came to resemble the dry loess cliffs that are common in Yan\u2019an, the endpoint of the Long March. More than <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/mar/18/world/la-fg-china-caves-20120318\">30 million</a> Chinese still live in caves that are dug into such cliffs. Throughout my journey, I boarded with local families or slept in discount rooms in village hotels, but as I approached Yan\u2019an, I took shelter in these cave-like dwellings. Reinforced with brick masonry and dug deep into the bases of mountains, the lodgings offered a respite from the summer sun. In <em>Red Star Over China</em>, the classic 1937 account of life in Yan\u2019an, U.S. journalist Edgar Snow <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Red-Star-over-China-Communism/dp/0802150934\">remarked</a> that the city\u2019s Red Army University \u201cwas probably the world\u2019s only seat of \u2018higher learning\u2019 whose classrooms were bombproof caves, with chairs and desks of stone and brick, and blackboards and walls of limestone and clay.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Chinese often refer to Yan\u2019an as the <a href=\"http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/102775/100668/204459/8277163.html\">\u201cRevolutionary Holy Land\u201d</a> and some even described it to me as the \u201cJerusalem of the East.\u201d In spite of the hype, Yan\u2019an looked like the other Chinese cities that I passed through on my trip: a crowded downtown intersection featured KFCs and a Pizza Hut, and vehicles zigzagged to the tune of drill-work and car horns. The air was dusty, and the river, which once flowed through the city center, had been reduced to a dry creek bed.</p>\n\n<p>At the Date Garden, the Party\u2019s temporary headquarters when they reached Yan\u2019an in 1935, I came upon a group of several hundred Chinese soldiers on a Party field trip, a handful of whom were solemnly pledging allegiance to the Communist Party, a requisite ritual to gain Party membership. The pledge begins with unremarkable promises to \u201cServe the Chinese people,\u201d but then escalates to vows like \u201cNever reveal the Party\u2019s secrets.\u201d Soldiers shooed me away as the new Communist devotees made their final promise: \u201cNever betray the Party.\u201d</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">***</p>\n\n<p>Among the Chinese people whom I met on the road, my Long March project usually elicited one of two responses, depending on age. Older people tended to express admiration for my trip. For many of them, the journey was so entwined with the nationalist propaganda of their upbringings that they automatically interpreted my trip as a form of heroism. They lauded my \u201cpatriotic spirit\u201d and sometimes even offered to treat me to dinner.

Michael Reynolds/European Pressphoto Agency WASHINGTON \u2014 When the Republican National Committee gathers for its winter meeting here on Wednesday, the action will start a few hours late to accommodate anyone who wants to stop first at the March for Life, the annual anti-abortion demonstration on the National Mall. And if they need a lift to the meeting afterward, they can hop on a free shuttle, courtesy of the Republican Party.\u201cWe thought it only fitting for our members to attend the march,\u201d said Reince Priebus, the party chairman.Abortion is becoming an unexpectedly animating issue in the 2014 midterm elections. Republicans, through state ballot initiatives and legislation in Congress, are using it to stoke enthusiasm among core supporters. Democrats, mindful of how potent the subject has been in recent campaigns like last year\u2019s governor\u2019s race in Virginia, are looking to rally female voters by portraying their conservative opponents as callous on women\u2019s issues.\u201cRepublicans have turned the floor of the House into the battleground for their relentless war on women\u2019s health care and freedoms,\u201d said Representative Steve Israel of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \u201cEvery time they launch another extreme attack against women\u2019s rights, they lose more ground with women voters.\u201d Reince Priebus Drew Angerer/The New York Times Aware that their candidates at times have struck the wrong tone on issues of women\u2019s health, Republicans in some states are now framing abortion in an economic context, arguing, for example, that the new federal health law uses public money to subsidize abortion coverage. In the House in the coming weeks, Republicans will make passing the \u201cNo Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act\u201d one of their top priorities this year.Democrats say their success this year will depend on how close they can come, given lower turnout, to President Obama\u2019s overwhelming margins with female voters; in 2008, he enjoyed a 14-point advantage among women, and in 2012, it was 12 points.The fraught politics of women\u2019s health care are already surfacing, as restrictions on abortion are appearing on state ballots and becoming the focus of debate in congressional races \u2014 many in places like North Carolina and Colorado that could hold the key to whether Republicans can sweep Democrats from power in the Senate and maintain their grip on the House.\u201cI don\u2019t think this is a niche issue anymore,\u201d said Drew Lieberman, a vice president at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, a political consultancy concern, who has advised Democratic congressional candidates and has done polling for Naral Pro-Choice America.In North Carolina, Senator Kay Hagan, a Democrat in a difficult re-election fight, and her allies plan to make an issue of the new restrictions on abortion approved by the Republican-led state legislature.In Colorado, where Senator Mark Udall, a Democrat, says anger over the Affordable Care Act could hurt his chances, social conservatives have succeeded in placing a constitutional amendment on the ballot that would enshrine legal protections for fetuses. Even if it fails, similar \u201cpersonhood\u201d measures in Colorado and elsewhere have given Republican turnout a boost in years past.In Oregon, Senator Jeff Merkley could face a similar situation if supporters of an initiative there succeed in getting an anti-abortion measure with a fiscally conservative twist on the ballot: the measure seeks to outlaw the use of state funds to pay for any abortion unless the mother is in grave medical danger.\u201cWe don\u2019t make this a pro-life thing,\u201d said Jeff Jimerson, who is organizing the petition drive. \u201cThis is a pro-taxpayer thing. There are a lot of libertarians in Oregon, people who don\u2019t really care what you do, just don\u2019t make me pay for it.\u201dCoupling the issue of abortion with a subject important to Republicans\u2019 Tea Party followers \u2014 government spending \u2014 is one way the party is recalibrating its election-year message. Republicans say that by framing the abortion debate in terms of fiscal conservatism, they can make a connection to the issue they believe will ultimately decide who controls Congress next year \u2014 the Affordable Care Act.\u201cFor a lot of members politically it ties into the issue they want to be talking about this election, which is Obamacare,\u201d said Tom McClusky, vice president for government affairs for the March for Life.Republican presidential candidates have almost universally opposed abortion rights. When Arlen Specter, then a Republican senator from Pennsylvania, ran for president in 1995 and declared he wanted to \u201ctake abortion out of politics,\u201d the right balked, and his candidacy was short-lived. But Republicans do see a danger in talking about it the wrong way.\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of tone as well as substance,\u201d said Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, who noted how Republicans hurt themselves in 2012 by picking congressional candidates like Representative Todd Akin of Missouri, whose infamous \u201clegitimate rape\u201d comments cost him his Senate candidacy and put his entire party on the defensive over women\u2019s issues.\u201cWhat do they want us to talk about?\u201d Mr. Reed said. \u201cRape and incest. What should the pro-life candidate talk about? Late-term abortions, sex-selection and Kermit Gosnell.\u201d Dr. Gosnell was convicted in Philadelphia last year of murdering babies after failed abortions.Mr. Priebus, the Republican chairman, will attend the March for Life this week, rare for a party leader. So will Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader. In years past, Republican presidents have addressed the march by phone or video message to avoid speaking in person.Nowhere was the power of the abortion issue more evident recently than in the governor\u2019s race in Virginia, where the Democratic candidate, Terry McAuliffe, won in November in part because women preferred him by nine percentage points over the Republican, Ken Cuccinelli, whom Democrats portrayed as extreme on women\u2019s issues.Nearly one-third \u2014 about $4.6 million \u2014 of the $16.4 million that Democrats and their allies spent on broadcast television advertising in Virginia last year dealt with abortion or birth control, according to an analysis by Kantar Media\u2019s Campaign Media Analysis Group, which tracks political advertising.Abortion rights groups have built targeting models that allow them to predict an individual voter\u2019s position on women\u2019s health issues. These models, along with similar ones built by the Obama campaign, were factors not just in Virginia last year but also in Democratic electoral victories in 2012.One state that Naral and Planned Parenthood Action Fund are studying is North Carolina, where they see parallels to Virginia. Demographic changes there are giving Democrats hope that it could swing back into their column.One of the leading contenders to be Ms. Hagan\u2019s opponent in November is Thom Tillis, the speaker of the State House, who voted for the tough restrictions on abortion. Democrats believe that would set them up to make the same kinds of sharp attacks that helped them prevail over Mr. Cuccinelli in November and over Mitt Romney in 2012.While Democrats say such measures seeking to restrict abortions could stir votes, they acknowledge the limits of midterm turnout. \u201cOff-year elections are difficult,\u201d said Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. \u201cYou have lower turnout, and a lot of drop-off voters are women. So in a lot of ways, making sure women are aware and voting is important.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on January 21, 2014, on page A1 of the New York edition with the headline: Parties Seize On Abortion Issues in Midterm Race.

Created nearly 80 years ago to supervise union elections and protect workers' rights to organize, the NLRB is a battleground for pro-labor Democrats and pro-management Republicans.Deep disagreement between the two sides over the NLRB's role - and over organized labor itself - makes disputes involving the board uncommonly bitter and subjects its agenda to constant reshaping, depending on which party controls the White House.\"It's no accident ... that this major constitutional showdown is occurring over appointments to the board,\" said AFL-CIO General Counsel Craig Becker, a former board member.Monday's case began as a labor dispute. The NLRB found in February 2012 that Noel Canning, a Pepsi bottler in Yakima, Washington, had reneged on a verbal contract during union negotiations. The company appealed to the courts, attracting the support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, conservative interest groups and Republican leaders in Congress. The case evolved into a constitutional challenge to the president's power to make appointments to key posts without Senate confirmation.At issue are \"recess appointments\" made in January 2012 by Democratic President Barack Obama to the NLRB. Two of these appointees presided over the board's Noel Canning deliberations, which the company and its supporters are contending was invalid.An NLRB spokesman declined to discuss the case.WOBBLY ENFORCEMENTSince its Great Depression origins, discord over the NLRB and the labor law it enforces have led to policy flip-flops and vacillating oversight as political power shifts in Washington.One measure of this is agency data on how often the board seeks court injunctions. In cases where it suspects a labor law violation, the five-member NLRB board can authorize seeking a court order, or injunction, telling an employer to halt a questionable practice while a case moves forward.Agency data for 1976-2011 show that when Democrats are in the White House, injunction authorizations rise, but when Republicans take over, authorizations decline, reflecting deep differences between the two parties about to what extent the board should intervene in labor disputes.Another indicator is sometimes startling flip-flops on labor law issues, experts said. Unlike courts, the NLRB is not bound by its prior case precedent and can alter past positions.For instance, the board has reversed course on whether graduate students at private universities can join labor unions. In 2000, under Democratic President Bill Clinton, the NLRB said New York University graduate students could unionize.In 2004, under Republican President George W. Bush, the board reversed that decision. Then under Obama, it said in 2012 that it would reconsider the Bush-era determination, though the union withdrew its case in a deal with the university.\"It's not good for the constituency the NLRB serves - whether it's employees, employers or unions - to have rules always in flux,\" said Marshall Babson, an NLRB member during the Republican administration of President Ronald Reagan.'G-- D--- LABOR BOARD'\"This agency has been controversial from Day One,\" said former NLRB Chair Wilma Liebman in an interview.An October 1938 article in Fortune, a business magazine, was headlined, \"The G-- D--- Labor Board,\" and called the law it was supposed to enforce a \"patently one-sided\" pro-union statute that was the most \"bitterly contested\" of all Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal legislation.A Republican-backed effort led to management-friendly amendments to the law in 1947. Liebman said modern-day board members still debate whether the agency's primary mission is enforcing the original statute or the amendments.\"That's one of the things that has created the flip flopping, the dissenting opinions, so much controversy,\" Liebman said. \"It's a statute that was never fully accepted.\"QUORUM CALLThe five-member board, picked by the president and subject to U.S. Senate confirmation, decides hundreds of cases each year. Three members are needed to decide a case. Members' five-year terms are staggered, with one expiring each year. Some board vacancies have gone unfilled in recent years.Before Obama installed the recess appointees contested by Noel Canning, the board had only two members and could not take official action. If the soda bottler prevails, the practical fallout for the NLRB will be limited. The Senate cut a deal in July that led to the confirmation of five NLRB members, marking the first time in a decade the board had all its seats filled.If Noel Canning wins, those members will likely have to re-decide more than 100 cases pending before U.S. appeals courts that challenge decisions made in part by recess appointees, Liebman said.But the larger question is whether the case could hobble efforts by Obama - and future presidents - to overcome political gridlock and fill key posts across the government.One NLRB member's term expires in December. So the turbulent agency's next vacancy - and another potential confirmation fight - is less than a year away.(Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Ken Wills)", "published": "Sun, 12 Jan 2014 17:38:39 GMT", "tags": ["politicsNews"], "title": "Supreme Court case highlights U.S. labor agency political divide", "updated": "Sun, 12 Jan 2014 17:38:39 GMT", "author": null, "url": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/Reuters/PoliticsNews/~3/tXnSE87X6jM/story01.htm", "_id": 191241815, "html": "<html><body><div><div id=\"articleInfo\">\n        <p class=\"byline\">By Amanda Becker and Carlyn Kolker</p>\n        <p>\n        <span class=\"location\">WASHINGTON/NEW YORK</span> <span class=\"pipe\"> </span> \n        <span class=\"timestamp\">Sun Jan 12, 2014 12:38pm EST</span>\n        </p>\n    </div>\n\n    <span id=\"articleText\">\n<span id=\"midArticle_start\"/>\n\n<span id=\"midArticle_0\"/><span class=\"focusParagraph\"><p><span class=\"articleLocation\">WASHINGTON/NEW YORK</span> (Reuters) - When the U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments on Monday in a case involving soda bottler Noel Canning Corp., presidential appointment power will be the main dispute, but the case will also put on display one of Washington's most politically polarizing agencies - the National Labor Relations Board.</p>\n</span><span id=\"midArticle_1\"/><p>Created nearly 80 years ago to supervise union elections and protect workers' rights to organize, the NLRB is a battleground for pro-labor Democrats and pro-management Republicans.</p><span id=\"midArticle_2\"/><p>Deep disagreement between the two sides over the NLRB's role - and over organized labor itself - makes disputes involving the board uncommonly bitter and subjects its agenda to constant reshaping, depending on which party controls the White House.</p><span id=\"midArticle_3\"/><p>\"It's no accident ... that this major constitutional showdown is occurring over appointments to the board,\" said AFL-CIO General Counsel Craig Becker, a former board member.</p><span id=\"midArticle_4\"/><p>Monday's case began as a labor dispute.

Photograph: Oliver Weiken/EPA The final journey was perhaps a fitting one for Israel's last great soldier-statesman. On the floor of an open-backed military truck, Ariel Sharon's coffin was brought up the hill overlooking his ranch on the edge of the Negev desert, to be placed in the ground next to his beloved late wife.The eight military generals first hoisted the flag-draped casket on to their shoulders with some difficulty, then manoeuvred it into the grave. Immediately they set to work emptying bags of soil into the cavity until the coffin containing the remains of one of the most divisive figures in Israel's history disappeared from view.This was the family's moment, following a formal state memorial ceremony at the Knesset in Jerusalem, and a military service at an army base in Latrun. But not all members of the family were admitted to the seated VIP area on the hill. Sharon's cousin, Slava Shnerov, 71, who had played with \"Arik\" as a child and last saw him comatose in a hospital bed eight years ago, had not been included on the list of special guests. \"No one informed me,\" she said, without bitterness. \"This is a sad day for Israel, not just the family.\"The VIP area was crowded with Israeli political and military figures and dignitaries from almost two dozen countries. Tony Blair was seated next to Israel's hardline foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman; the US vice-president, Joe Biden, was also present. Only the Czechs sent a head of state.Sharon died on Saturday after spending eight years in a coma that struck him at the height of a decades-long career which saw him lauded as a military hero and statesman, but also reviled as a warmongering criminal. He was 85.Speaking on Monday morning at the Knesset ceremony, Biden urged Israelis to remember Sharon's mistakes as well as his triumphs, and acknowledged US differences with the former prime minister. But he added: \"History will judge that he lived in complex times, in a very complex neighbourhood.\"Blair, the Middle East envoy for the Quartet, said Sharon had fought for the state of Israel both in the field of war and the diplomacy chamber. \"He had the imagination to know that genuine peace, if attainable with honour and dignity both for Arabs and Israelis, was the anchor ultimately for Israel's security.\"Israel's prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, acknowledged that he had not always seen eye to eye with Sharon, particularly over the pullout from Gaza. But he added: \"Arik understood that in matters of our existence and security, we must stand firm. We are sticking to these principles.\"Security was very tight in the area surrounding Sharon's Shikmim farm for the funeral. No private cars were allowed access \u2013 instead special coaches were laid on from a nearby technical college, where mourners' possessions were passed through scanners.A helicopter circled overhead and a surveillance balloon hovered nearby.

On the floor of an open-backed military truck, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ariel-sharon\" title=\"More from the Guardian on Ariel Sharon\">Ariel Sharon</a>'s coffin was brought up the hill overlooking his ranch on the edge of the Negev desert, to be placed in the ground next to his beloved late wife.</p><p>The eight military generals first hoisted the flag-draped casket on to their shoulders with some difficulty, then manoeuvred it into the grave. Immediately they set to work emptying bags of soil into the cavity until the coffin containing the remains of one of the most divisive figures in Israel's history disappeared from view.</p><p>This was the family's moment, following a formal state memorial ceremony at the Knesset in Jerusalem, and a military service at an army base in Latrun. But not all members of the family were admitted to the seated VIP area on the hill. Sharon's cousin, Slava Shnerov, 71, who had played with \"Arik\" as a child and last saw him comatose in a hospital bed eight years ago, had not been included on the list of special guests. \"No one informed me,\" she said, without bitterness. \"This is a sad day for Israel, not just the family.\"</p><p>The VIP area was crowded with Israeli political and military figures and dignitaries from almost two dozen countries. Tony Blair was seated next to Israel's hardline foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman; the US vice-president, Joe Biden, was also present. Only the Czechs sent a head of state.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/11/former-israeli-pm-ariel-sharon-dies\" title=\"\">Sharon died on Saturday</a> after spending eight years in a coma that struck him at the height of a decades-long career which saw him lauded as a military hero and statesman, but also reviled as a warmongering criminal. He was 85.</p><p>Speaking on Monday morning at the Knesset ceremony, Biden urged Israelis to remember Sharon's mistakes as well as his triumphs, and acknowledged US differences with the former prime minister. But he added: \"History will judge that he lived in complex times, in a very complex neighbourhood.\"</p><p>Blair, the Middle East envoy for the Quartet, said Sharon had fought for the state of Israel both in the field of war and the diplomacy chamber. \"He had the imagination to know that genuine peace, if attainable with honour and dignity both for Arabs and Israelis, was the anchor ultimately for Israel's security.\"</p><p>Israel's prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, acknowledged that he had not always seen eye to eye with Sharon, particularly over the pullout from Gaza. But he added: \"Arik understood that in matters of our existence and security, we must stand firm. We are sticking to these principles.\"</p><p>Security was very tight in the area surrounding Sharon's Shikmim farm for the funeral. No private cars were allowed access \u2013 instead special coaches were laid on from a nearby technical college, where mourners' possessions were passed through scanners.</p><p>A helicopter circled overhead and a surveillance balloon hovered nearby. An area on top of a hill near to the spot where Sharon was laid to rest alongside his late wife, Lily, was penned off with crash barriers.

As part of the drive, titled \"More than meets the eye\", television and cinema adverts will show how the Army Reserve is integrated with its counterpart. The Army is being cut from 100,000 troops to some 82,000, but the Ministry of Defence says it needs new recruits. It wants to increase the size of the Army Reserve from 19,000 to 30,000, but has failed to meet its targets so far. 'Challenge and adventure' Meanwhile, a poll commissioned by the Army to mark the campaign's launch suggested that 23% of people were not satisfied with their current career. When asked what was missing 30% said a decent salary; 27% said excellent training and personal development; 25% said a challenging and exciting role; 35% said UK and overseas travel; and 18% said getting paid while getting qualifications. The research, carried out by OnePoll, surveyed 2,000 people in December 2013. BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said this was the Army's third campaign in a year - stressing it had so far failed to meet its targets for recruiting reservists. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: \"In 2014, the Army will continue to recruit new full-time soldiers and look to increase the trained strength of part-time soldiers. \"Army reserves will be critical to mounting military operations in the future and we intend to grow the number significantly by 2018.\" Chief of the General Staff, Gen Sir Peter Wall, said: \"The Army offers people unique opportunities for challenge and adventure, both at home and overseas, during peacetime and on operations. \"It develops personal qualities that are key to success in any walk of life: leadership, judgement, determination, and physical stamina.\" Later in January, the Army will announce the fourth round of its redundancy programme as the overall size of the regular force continues to be reduced. January will also see the MoD launching a simplified online application form, a more streamlined medical clearance process and an army fitness app to make it easier for potential recruits to join.", "published": "Sat, 11 Jan 2014 02:53:34 GMT", "tags": null, "title": "Army launches \u00a33m recruitment drive", "updated": "Sat, 11 Jan 2014 02:53:34 GMT", "author": null, "url": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25688136#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa", "_id": 192353537, "html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"story-body\">\n    \t\t  <span class=\"story-date\">&#13;\n    <span class=\"date\">10 January 2014</span>&#13;\n<span class=\"time-text\">Last updated at </span><span class=\"time\">21:53 ET</span>&#13;\n\t  &#13;\n</span>&#13;\n&#13;\n\t&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n&#13;\n\t<h1 class=\"story-header\">Army launches \u00a33m recruitment drive</h1>&#13;\n&#13;\n     &#13;\n         &#13;\n \n    \n    \n\t\t\n        <div class=\"caption body-width\">&#13;\n  <img src=\"http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/72213000/jpg/_72213395_emb_hqscot-2014-001-0167.jpg\" alt=\"Army campaign\"/>&#13;\n&#13;\n    <span>The campaign has been dubbed 'More than meets the eye'</span>&#13;\n  </div>&#13;\n\t&#13;\n                      <p class=\"introduction\" id=\"story_continues_1\">The British army is launching a \u00a33m recruitment campaign aimed at boosting both the regular and reserve forces. </p>&#13;\n        <p>As part of the drive, titled \"More than meets the eye\", television and cinema adverts will show how the Army Reserve is integrated with its counterpart. </p>&#13;\n        <p>The Army is being cut from 100,000 troops to some 82,000, but the Ministry of Defence says it needs new recruits. </p>&#13;\n        <p>It wants to increase the size of the Army Reserve from 19,000 to 30,000, but has failed to meet its targets so far.</p>&#13;\n  <span class=\"cross-head\">'Challenge and adventure'</span>&#13;\n\t      <p>Meanwhile, a poll commissioned by the Army to mark the campaign's launch suggested that 23% of people were not satisfied with their current career.</p>&#13;\n        <p>When asked what was missing 30% said a decent salary; 27% said excellent training and personal development; 25% said a challenging and exciting role; 35% said UK and overseas travel; and 18% said getting paid while getting qualifications.</p>&#13;\n        <p>The research, carried out by OnePoll, surveyed 2,000 people in December 2013.</p>&#13;\n        <p>BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said this was the Army's third campaign in a year - stressing it had so far failed to meet its targets for recruiting reservists.</p>&#13;\n        <p>Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: \"In 2014, the Army will continue to recruit new full-time soldiers and look to increase the trained strength of part-time soldiers.</p>&#13;\n        <p>\"Army reserves will be critical to mounting military operations in the future and we intend to grow the number significantly by 2018.\"</p>&#13;\n        <p>Chief of the General Staff, Gen Sir Peter Wall, said: \"The Army offers people unique opportunities for challenge and adventure, both at home and overseas, during peacetime and on operations.</p>&#13;\n        <p>\"It develops personal qualities that are key to success in any walk of life: leadership, judgement, determination, and physical stamina.\"</p>&#13;\n        <p>Later in January, the Army will announce the fourth round of its redundancy programme as the overall size of the regular force continues to be reduced.</p>&#13;\n        <p>January will also see the MoD launching a simplified online application form, a more streamlined medical clearance process and an army fitness app to make it easier for potential recruits to join.</p>&#13;\n  \n\n\t</div>\n  \n  </div></body></html>"}, {"source": "http://feeds.theguardian.com/theguardian/us/rss", "text": "Princess Cristina has been linked to the business affairs of her husband, former Olympic handball player Inaki Urdangarin. Photograph: Gustau Nacarino/Reuters The Spanish royal family was battered by further scandal on Tuesday when the youngest daughter of King Juan Carlos was named as a formal suspect in a long-running corruption inquiry.Princess Cristina, 48, has been summoned to answer allegations of money laundering and tax evasion. The princess would be the first member of the king's family to appear in court since the restoration of the monarchy in 1975.The charges relate to alleged embezzlement by her husband, I\u00f1aki Urdangarin. The former Olympic handball player and his business partner, Diego Torres, are accused of siphoning off \u20ac5.8m (\u00a34.8m) of public funds.The money was allegedly funnelled through their not-for-profit Instituto N\u00f3os and their family business Aizoon, of which Cristina is co-owner.The princess will now have to testify in Palma de Mallorca on 8 March.How much Cristina knew of her husband's allegedly shady activities is hotly contested. Cristina and Urdangarin deny any wrongdoing. Last year the investigating judge, Jos\u00e9 Castro, targeted the princess for the first time \u2013 only for Mallorca's provincial court to throw out his ruling.After gathering further evidence Castro named Cristina on Tuesday as an official suspect for a second time. A more senior judge may again decide that the princess should be spared from giving evidence.The scandal exposes the murky interstices between royals and entrepreneurship, a perennial source of trouble for modern-day noble houses.Urdangarin and Torres are accused of exploiting their connections to take money from the regional governments of Valencia and the Balearic Islands, both of whose presidents have faced a string of corruption charges.In theory, the king's son-in-law organised sports and tourism conferences and provided consultancy advice. In practice, it is alleged, much of the work between 2004-06 was nonexistent, with the cash disappearing into privately owned companies and offshore tax havens.This subterranean revenue stream helped fund lavish home improvements, investigators claim. Several of the allegations concern Cristina and Urdangarin's \u20ac6m mansion in a fashionable district of Barcelona, which was done up with a further \u20ac3m.There have been questions too over how the couple were able to obtain a massive \u20ac5m mortgage. The house has since been confiscated to cover Torres and Urdangarin's \u20ac6.1m bail. The net began to close on Cristina when documents showed she had signed herself as both owner and tenant of her marital mansion.Castro has defended his rigorous inquiry into the affair, describing it as the impartial application of justice. The judge said putting the princess on the stand would remove \"any shadow of suspicion\" that she is receiving special treatment, El Pais reported.Ana Mar\u00eda Tejeiro, Torres's wife, has been indicted since the start of the investigation while Cristina was treated as being above suspicion. \"Are not all Spaniards equal before the law?\" Tejeiro's lawyer asked the judge rhetorically.Tuesday's news is the latest blow to the already tarnished image of the Spanish royal family. King Juan Carlos was crowned in 1975, two days after the death of the dictator Franco. He became the darling of the fledgling Spanish democracy when he played a key role in stopping an attempted military coup in 1981.From then on the royals were untouchable and when Cristina married Urdangarin in Barcelona in 1997, only weeks after Princess Diana's death, many in Spain hoped she would fill Diana's shoes as a pretty, modern, self-assured princess. The King gave the pair the title Dukes of Palma.However, the royals began to lose their shine, starting with rumours of the king's extramarital affairs and then the divorce of Cristina's older sister, Elena, in 2009.Then, two years ago, Juan Carlos was photographed standing proudly next to the elephant he shot on a hunting trip in Botswana. This proved too much for many Spaniards. Not only was the king honorary president of the WWF but embarking on such an expensive trip when more than five million were out of work in Spain seemed proof that the royals were out of touch.In November Juan Carlos had hip surgery, and during a public appearance on Monday he seemed unsteady. Increasingly frail, a recent opinion poll by El Mundo said 62% of Spaniards would like him to abdicate in favour of his son, the popular Crown Prince Felipe.The royal household responded on Tuesday to the judge's summons by saying it had \"maximum respect for judicial decisions\", but the head of the king's household, Rafael Spottorno, said in a recent television interview that the three-year investigation had become a \"martyrdom\" for the already scandal-beset royal family.In his 227-page decree, Castro said that it would have been \"difficult for Urdangarin to defraud Inland Revenue without his wife's knowledge and acquiescence\", adding that Cristina \"chose to look the other way\".In the unlikely event that she is found guilty, Cristina faces up to six years in prison for money laundering and a fine of three times the value of the money laundered, as well as further punishment for tax evasion.

The first big China investigative story of the year has come from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which on Tuesday published, in tandem with several Western news organizations, a detailed look at the widespread use of offshore companies and tax havens by Chinese businesspeople and relatives of Communist Party leaders. The investigation into Chinese activity primarily in the British Virgin Islands originated with a trove of financial documents leaked to the consortium, a nonprofit group based in Washington. On Wednesday, the group published in both English and Chinese its second big story on China, a case study of a former Chinese oil industry executive who set up dozens of shell companies in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda and the British Virgin Islands. The report also said that the leaked documents show China\u2019s three large state-owned oil companies \u2014 the biggest players in an industry rife with corruption \u2014 and executives at those enterprises set up dozens of offshore shell companies between 1995 and 2008. The case study lays out how Sun Tiangang, the former executive, made a fortune as an entrepreneur in the oil industry before having his main company and its assets seized by former employees allied with powerful state interests. The reporters, Alexa Olesen and Michael Hudson, based their narrative on interviews with Mr. Sun and on a lawsuit he filed last year in a United States district court in Los Angeles against Sinopec, one of the three giant Chinese state-owned oil enterprises and the fourth-biggest company in the world. In the lawsuit, Mr. Sun accused Sinopec of working with police officials to illegally imprison him for five years, starting in 2005, and strip him of a company in the British Virgin Islands he had set up in connection to a profitable oil pipeline contract in the western Chinese region of Xinjiang. Even after Mr. Sun was released from jail in 2010, the lawsuit said, he was kept under a form of house arrest for two more years. The lawsuit said Sinopec did not want to honor the 20-year contract and had built its own pipeline to move oil from the Tahe field in Xinjiang. Sinopec did not respond to repeated requests for comment from the reporters. Lawyers for the defendant have asked the U.S. court to dismiss the lawsuit because it is \u201ca quintessentially foreign dispute,\u201d according to a court filing. Mr. Sun\u2019s colorful tale brings into the spotlight many questionable practices common to business in China. One is the use of so-called reverse mergers to get Chinese companies listed on stock exchanges, but in a way that masks their identity and core business. This practice of backdoor listings has come under growing scrutiny by American officials. Mr. Sun got his oil pipeline joint venture onto the Hong Kong Stock Exchange by folding the British Virgin Islands company he had started, which was the majority shareholder in the oil pipeline business, into a food company that was listed on the exchange in 2001. Mr. Sun then changed the listed company\u2019s name to GeoMaxima Holdings and spun off the food business. The article explained that this was a way around what Mr. Sun regarded as onerous restrictions. At the time, companies registered in the British Virgin Islands could not list in Hong Kong, nor could a mainland-registered company unless it had approval from officials in Beijing, which was difficult to secure. The overview published on Tuesday of Chinese use of offshore shell companies said that there are legitimate reasons to set up such companies. The practice started becoming popular among Chinese businesspeople in the 1990s because the executives wanted, among other things, to get around strict capital controls and investment laws that favored foreign companies over domestic ones. But there are more shadowy motivations too. The companies are tax shelters, and they can also hide the identities of important stakeholders. Mr. Sun said that setting up a company in the British Virgin Islands costs just a few hundred dollars and \u201cgives very strong cover\u201d by allowing the real owner to stay off stage. Forty percent of offshore business in the British Virgin Islands comes from China and other Asian nations, the report said, citing officials in the islands. Among the clients are executives at the three Chinese oil giants: the China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation, or Sinopec; the China National Petroleum Corporation, or PetroChina; and the China National Offshore Oil Company, or Cnooc. The report said there were no signs of illegal activity by these executives or the oil enterprises, but the secretive nature of the offshore companies makes it difficult to pinpoint why the companies were set up. Executives at PetroChina have been detained as part of a wide-ranging corruption investigation by Communist Party officials. Party insiders say the main target of the investigation is Zhou Yongkang, the former member of the ruling Politburo Standing Committee who worked in the oil industry and, later, oversaw the domestic security agencies. Two smaller companies implicated in the PetroChina investigation have ties to offshore shell companies that show up in the leaked documents. Hua Bangsong, the founder of one of the two implicated companies, Wison Engineering Services, listed in Hong Kong, incorporated three Wison-related companies in the British Virgin Islands in 2003. Wison suspended its public trading in September and announced that Chinese officials had seized some books and records and had frozen some of its bank accounts as part of the investigation. It has said Mr. Hua is cooperating with officials. The other company implicated in the investigation that has links to a British Virgin Islands company is Zhongxu Investment Co. Ltd., which manages gas stations for PetroChina and runs hydropower plants. Caixin, a respected Chinese news magazine, reported that Wu Bing, the head of Zhongxu, was taken away from the Beijing West Railway Station on Aug. 1 and has not been seen since.", "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2014 16:05:50 GMT", "tags": ["Hong Kong Stock Exchange", "China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (Sinopec)", "Sinopec Corp", "Beijing (China)", "sun tiangang", "China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (Sinopec)|SNP|NYSE", "Caixin", "China National Petroleum Corp", "PetroChina Company Ltd", "Zhou Yongkang", "China", "China National Offshore Oil", "International Consortium of Investigative Journalists", "Communist Party of China", "PetroChina Company Ltd|PTR|NYSE"], "title": "Sinosphere Blog: Investigative Stories Delve Into the Use of Offshore Companies by Chinese", "updated": "Thu, 23 Jan 2014 16:05:50 GMT", "author": "By EDWARD WONG", "url": "http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/23/investigative-stories-delve-into-the-use-of-offshore-companies-by-chinese/?partner=rss&emc=rss", "_id": 198191035, "html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content\"><div class=\"w592\"><img src=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/01/23/world/23sino-oil02/23sino-oil02-tmagArticle.jpg\" id=\"100000002666462\" alt=\"Sun Tiangang has filed a lawsuit accusing the state-owned oil enterprise Sinopec of working with police officials to illegally imprison him for five years.\"/><span class=\"credit\">Michal Czerwonka for ICIJ</span> <span class=\"caption\">Sun Tiangang has filed a lawsuit accusing the state-owned oil enterprise Sinopec of working with police officials to illegally imprison him for five years.</span></div>\n\n<p class=\"story-body-text\"/>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">The first big China investigative story of the year has come from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which on Tuesday published, in tandem with several Western news organizations, a <a href=\"http://www.icij.org/offshore/leaked-records-reveal-offshore-holdings-chinas-elite\">detailed look</a> at the widespread use of offshore companies and tax havens by Chinese businesspeople and relatives of Communist Party leaders.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">The investigation into Chinese activity primarily in the British Virgin Islands originated with a trove of financial documents leaked to the consortium, a <a href=\"http://www.icij.org/\">nonprofit group </a>based in Washington.

As Hagel visited F.E. Warren Air Force Base and toured a missile site in nearby Nebraska, two Air Force officers belonging to a missile launch crew at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana had their security clearances suspended after they were implicated in an illegal narcotics operation.The force responsible for the 450 nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missiles at three U.S. bases has been troubled by morale issues, a factor acknowledged by Hagel during a two-day tour of nuclear arms installations in New Mexico and Wyoming.Major General Michael Carey was fired as head of the ICBM force in October for getting drunk and carousing with Russian women while leading a government delegation to Moscow for talks on nuclear security.Speaking at F.E. Warren after touring the missile site in Nebraska, Hagel did not refer to the suspended officers in Montana, and he only indirectly spoke to the morale issues in the force, praising the troops for their work and telling them the American people were counting on them.\"You have chosen a profession where there is no room for error. In what you do every day, there is no room for error, none, and you know that, the American people expect that. They have that confidence in you,\" Hagel said.He commended the professionalism and commitment he saw during his visit to the base, saying \"we all have a lot of responsibility and we all must deliver.\"\"How you do the job, really, is as important as the job itself because it sets a standard of expectations for yourselves and everybody around you. People pay attention to that,\" the defense secretary said.Hagel said he had come away from his tour of the missile alert facility, which was across the border in his home state of Nebraska, with a renewed appreciation for the need to modernize the U.S. nuclear force in order to maintain a secure and reliable deterrent.\"It's clear we've got some work to do on modernization,\" he told the troops.The United States is at the start of a multi-decade effort to upgrade its nuclear weapons complex, from modernizing 1970s-era bombs with modern electronic components to replacing aging nuclear ballistic missile submarines, long range bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles.Hagel said the Pentagon was nearing completion of a study to determine the ICBM that will be built to replace the current Minuteman III missile. A defense official said later the study would be completed this spring.But arms control groups and others have raised concerns about the high cost of the elaborate plans and have questioned why taxpayers should rebuild much of the U.S. nuclear force at a time when the Obama administration is advocating cutting the size of the deployed arsenal by one third.The Congressional Budget Office estimated it would cost $355 billion over a decade to carry out the administration's plans.

The first big China investigative story of the year has come from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which on Tuesday published, in tandem with several Western news organizations, a detailed look at the widespread use of offshore companies and tax havens by Chinese businesspeople and relatives of Communist Party leaders. The investigation into Chinese activity primarily in the British Virgin Islands originated with a trove of financial documents leaked to the consortium, a nonprofit group based in Washington. On Wednesday, the group published in both English and Chinese its second big story on China, a case study of a former Chinese oil industry executive who set up dozens of shell companies in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda and the British Virgin Islands. The report also said that the leaked documents show China\u2019s three large state-owned oil companies \u2014 the biggest players in an industry rife with corruption \u2014 and executives at those enterprises set up dozens of offshore shell companies between 1995 and 2008. The case study lays out how Sun Tiangang, the former executive, made a fortune as an entrepreneur in the oil industry before having his main company and its assets seized by former employees allied with powerful state interests. The reporters, Alexa Olesen and Michael Hudson, based their narrative on interviews with Mr. Sun and on a lawsuit he filed last year in a United States district court in Los Angeles against Sinopec, one of the three giant Chinese state-owned oil enterprises and the fourth-biggest company in the world. In the lawsuit, Mr. Sun accused Sinopec of working with police officials to illegally imprison him for five years, starting in 2005, and strip him of a company in the British Virgin Islands he had set up in connection to a profitable oil pipeline contract in the western Chinese region of Xinjiang. Even after Mr. Sun was released from jail in 2010, the lawsuit said, he was kept under a form of house arrest for two more years. The lawsuit said Sinopec did not want to honor the 20-year contract and had built its own pipeline to move oil from the Tahe field in Xinjiang. Sinopec did not respond to repeated requests for comment from the reporters. Lawyers for the defendant have asked the U.S. court to dismiss the lawsuit because it is \u201ca quintessentially foreign dispute,\u201d according to a court filing. Mr. Sun\u2019s colorful tale brings into the spotlight many questionable practices common to business in China. One is the use of so-called reverse mergers to get Chinese companies listed on stock exchanges, but in a way that masks their identity and core business. This practice of backdoor listings has come under growing scrutiny by American officials. Mr. Sun got his oil pipeline joint venture onto the Hong Kong Stock Exchange by folding the British Virgin Islands company he had started, which was the majority shareholder in the oil pipeline business, into a food company that was listed on the exchange in 2001. Mr. Sun then changed the listed company\u2019s name to GeoMaxima Holdings and spun off the food business. The article explained that this was a way around what Mr. Sun regarded as onerous restrictions. At the time, companies registered in the British Virgin Islands could not list in Hong Kong, nor could a mainland-registered company unless it had approval from officials in Beijing, which was difficult to secure. The overview published on Tuesday of Chinese use of offshore shell companies said that there are legitimate reasons to set up such companies. The practice started becoming popular among Chinese businesspeople in the 1990s because the executives wanted, among other things, to get around strict capital controls and investment laws that favored foreign companies over domestic ones. But there are more shadowy motivations too. The companies are tax shelters, and they can also hide the identities of important stakeholders. Mr. Sun said that setting up a company in the British Virgin Islands costs just a few hundred dollars and \u201cgives very strong cover\u201d by allowing the real owner to stay off stage. Forty percent of offshore business in the British Virgin Islands comes from China and other Asian nations, the report said, citing officials in the islands. Among the clients are executives at the three Chinese oil giants: the China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation, or Sinopec; the China National Petroleum Corporation, or PetroChina; and the China National Offshore Oil Company, or Cnooc. The report said there were no signs of illegal activity by these executives or the oil enterprises, but the secretive nature of the offshore companies makes it difficult to pinpoint why the companies were set up. Executives at PetroChina have been detained as part of a wide-ranging corruption investigation by Communist Party officials. Party insiders say the main target of the investigation is Zhou Yongkang, the former member of the ruling Politburo Standing Committee who worked in the oil industry and, later, oversaw the domestic security agencies. Two smaller companies implicated in the PetroChina investigation have ties to offshore shell companies that show up in the leaked documents. Hua Bangsong, the founder of one of the two implicated companies, Wison Engineering Services, listed in Hong Kong, incorporated three Wison-related companies in the British Virgin Islands in 2003. Wison suspended its public trading in September and announced that Chinese officials had seized some books and records and had frozen some of its bank accounts as part of the investigation. It has said Mr. Hua is cooperating with officials. The other company implicated in the investigation that has links to a British Virgin Islands company is Zhongxu Investment Co. Ltd., which manages gas stations for PetroChina and runs hydropower plants. Caixin, a respected Chinese news magazine, reported that Wu Bing, the head of Zhongxu, was taken away from the Beijing West Railway Station on Aug. 1 and has not been seen since.", "published": "Thu, 23 Jan 2014 12:59:13 GMT", "tags": ["Hong Kong Stock Exchange", "China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (Sinopec)", "Sinopec Corp", "Beijing (China)", "sun tiangang", "China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (Sinopec)|SNP|NYSE", "Caixin", "China National Petroleum Corp", "PetroChina Company Ltd", "Zhou Yongkang", "China", "China National Offshore Oil", "International Consortium of Investigative Journalists", "Communist Party of China", "PetroChina Company Ltd|PTR|NYSE"], "title": "Sinosphere Blog: Investigative Stories Delve Into the Use of Offshore Companies by Chinese", "updated": "Thu, 23 Jan 2014 12:59:13 GMT", "author": "By EDWARD WONG", "url": "http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/23/investigative-stories-delve-into-the-use-of-offshore-companies-by-chinese/?partner=rss&emc=rss", "_id": 199763903, "html": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content\"><div class=\"w592\"><img src=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/01/23/world/23sino-oil02/23sino-oil02-tmagArticle.jpg\" id=\"100000002666462\" alt=\"Sun Tiangang has filed a lawsuit accusing the state-owned oil enterprise Sinopec of working with police officials to illegally imprison him for five years.\"/><span class=\"credit\">Michal Czerwonka for ICIJ</span> <span class=\"caption\">Sun Tiangang has filed a lawsuit accusing the state-owned oil enterprise Sinopec of working with police officials to illegally imprison him for five years.</span></div>\n\n<p class=\"story-body-text\"/>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">The first big China investigative story of the year has come from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which on Tuesday published, in tandem with several Western news organizations, a <a href=\"http://www.icij.org/offshore/leaked-records-reveal-offshore-holdings-chinas-elite\">detailed look</a> at the widespread use of offshore companies and tax havens by Chinese businesspeople and relatives of Communist Party leaders.</p>\n<p class=\"story-body-text\">The investigation into Chinese activity primarily in the British Virgin Islands originated with a trove of financial documents leaked to the consortium, a <a href=\"http://www.icij.org/\">nonprofit group </a>based in Washington.
