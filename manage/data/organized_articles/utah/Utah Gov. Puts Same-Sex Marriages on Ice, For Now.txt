Reuters The U.S. Supreme Court’s order last week suspending gay marriage left it unclear whether the state would recognize the hundreds of same-sex couples who already obtained licenses. The state of limbo is now official. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert’s chief of staff sent a memo to state agencies on Tuesday evening directing them to stop recognizing those marriages for the time being while a lawsuit challenging the state’s laws restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples works its way through appeals. “Based on counsel from the Attorney General’s Office regarding the Supreme Court decision, state recognition of same-sex marital status is ON HOLD until further notice,” the memo said. The instructions apply to the roughly 1,000 couples who got married between Dec. 20 — when a federal judge ordered Utah to allow same-sex couples to wed — and Jan. 6 when the Supreme Court suspended enforcement of the decision at least until the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals weighs in. “Wherever individuals are in the process of availing themselves of state services related to same-sex marital status, that process is on hold and will stay exactly in that position until a final court decision is issued,” the memo says. It continues: “For example, if a same-sex married couple previously changed their names on new drivers licenses, those licenses should not be revoked. If a same-sex couple seeks to change their names on drivers licenses now, the law does not allow the state agency to recognize the marriage therefore the new drivers licenses cannot be issued.”
