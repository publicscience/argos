Andrew Sullivan and David Frum debate major issues posed by legalization in Colorado and beyond. As pot shops open in Colorado, two of America’s leading conservative thinkers find themselves on opposite sides of the legalization question. Andrew Sullivan and David Frum debate the issue for nearly an hour on my website Bloggingheads.tv, but above you can find a way shorter highlight reel. It contains not only Frum’s and Sullivan’s key disagreements, but also their several points of convergence. Crystallizing these two elements—common ground as well as differences of opinion—is the mission of The Good Fight, the series inaugurated by the Frum-Sullivan matchup. A boiled-down version of each debate, like the one above, will appear on The Atlantic whenever a full-length version appears on BhTV.
