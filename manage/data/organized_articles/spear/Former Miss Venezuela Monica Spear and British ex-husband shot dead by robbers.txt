Monica Spear, 29, and 39-year-old British citizen Thomas Henry Berry, the owner of a travel agency, were killed on a roadside near Venezuela's main port of Puerto Cabello.The director of the country's investigative police, Jose Gregorio Sierralta, told reporters that the car had hit "a sharp object that had been placed on the highway."He said the attack occurred after the car had been lifted onto a tow truck and the family locked themselves in their car after they saw assailants approaching.Their 5-year-old daughter received medical attention for a minor leg injury, but was believed to be in a stable condition following the events. She is currently with her relatives in Caracas.The family had spent New Year's in the mountains of the western state of Merida then traveled to the plains, said Luis Carlos Dominguez, a longtime friend and former business associate of Mr Berry.He added that Mr Berry was raised in Venezuela and ran a travel agency. "He knew Venezuela a lot better than many Venezuelans," said Dominguez, describing the pair as people "who really loved the country," and continued to have a good relationship despite their divorce.They had made a point to vacation together for the benefit of their daughter, he said. Five people have been arrested in connection with the attack, including some under 18 years of age.Mr Sierralta added that the Government will work hard to identify the killers and subsequently tackle murder in Venezuela.The President and Hugo Chavez’ successor Nicolas Maduro said: “It is very sad and we feel the pain of this loss” and that Ms Spear was "a very spiritual young woman" actively involved in various charities.Ms Spear won Miss Venezuela in 2004 and had acted in numerous soap operas for the US based Telemundo network, most recently Pasion Prohibida.Venezuela has one of the world’s highest murder rates, and Ms Spear’s death has triggered anger on social media directed at the populist government’s poor record on crime.It is reported that people in Venezuela live in fear of crime and therefore tend to stay indoors after dark. Foreign ambassadors and professional baseball players have in the past been victim of kidnappings.The Venezuelan Observatory of Violence says the South American country's murder rate was 79 per 100,000 inhabitants last year. However, the Government’s statistics show the rate as lower.Additional reporting by AP
