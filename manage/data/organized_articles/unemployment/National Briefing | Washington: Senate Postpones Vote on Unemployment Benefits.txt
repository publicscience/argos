Senate leaders on Monday night abruptly postponed a vote to take up a measure extending expired unemployment benefits. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, was about to call the vote when the Senateâ€™s No. 2 Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, accused him of manufacturing a political issue by holding a vote with 17 senators absent, mostly because of weather delays. Mr. Reid than gruffly asked for consent to postpone it until Tuesday morning. The measure is expected to fall to a Republican filibuster.
