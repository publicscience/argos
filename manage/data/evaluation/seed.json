Seven men, including Sechin, were targeted by visa bans and freezing of any U.S. assets, and 17 companies were also named.\n\n\"The goal is not to go after Mr. Putin personally,\" Obama said. \"The goal is to change his calculus with respect to how the current actions that he's engaging in Ukraine could have an adverse impact on the Russian economy over the long haul.\"\n\nWashington will also deny export licenses for any high-technology items that could contribute to Russian military capabilities and revoke any existing export licenses that meet these conditions, the White House said.\n\nIn addition to Sechin, the Russians sanctioned by the United States included another Putin ally, Sergei Chemezov, head of Rostec, a Russian state-owned high-tech products company.\n\nThe others named were Oleg Belavencev, Putin's presidential envoy to Crimea, Dmitry Kozak, deputy prime minister of the Russian Federation, Evgeniy Murov, director of Russia's federal protective service, Aleksei Pushkov, a state Duma deputy, and Vyacheslav Volodin, a Putin adviser.\n\nNot included was Gazprom chief Alexei Miller, a close ally of Putin who had been seen as a possible target.\n\nObama is under pressure from opposition Republicans at home to move faster on sanctions. But in taking what he described as \"calibrated steps\", he has emphasized a need to act in concert with European countries, which have more at stake economically and a more cumbersome process for taking decisions.\n\nThere was little prospect of a change in the calculus for Putin, who critics say is stirring up fear among ethnic Russians in order to redraw post-Soviet borders and rebuild Moscow's empire.\n\n\"Washington is in effect reviving ... an old method of restricting normal cooperation, from Cold War times, essentially chasing itself into a dark, dusty closet of a bygone era,\" said Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, describing the sanctions as illegitimate, uncivilized and in breach of international law.\n\nIn an hour-long phone call with U.S. Pentagon chief Chuck Hagel, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu voiced concern about an \"unprecedented\" increase in U.S. and NATO activity near Russia's borders and urged Hagel to help \"turn down the rhetoric\" over Ukraine, Moscow's Defense Ministry said.\n\nBoth sides continue to offer diametrically mirror-image versions of events in Ukraine. The West sees the pro-Western leaders who took power after Kremlin-backed President Viktor Yanukovich fled to Russia in February as legitimate and believes Putin is trying to undermine their efforts to hold an election.\n\nFor Moscow, they are \"fascists\" and \"putschists\", anti-Russian Ukrainian nationalists against whom the Russian speakers of Crimea and the east have risen up in self-defence - a view it broadcasts into Ukraine on state-run Russian media.\n\nOpinion polls show substantial but still only minority support in the depressed, industrial east of Ukraine for it to follow Crimea into union with Russia.\n\nSeveral people were injured on Monday after dozens of men in military fatigues, carrying baseball bats and throwing firecrackers, tried to break up a demonstration in Donetsk.\n\nA crowd of about 2,000 waved Ukrainian flags and chanted: \"Donetsk is Ukraine\" and \"Putin, no\", but they dispersed after the assault, in which Reuters journalists saw at least 10 people treated for head injuries.\n\nEarlier in the same region, armed men in camouflage who refused to identify themselves seized the police station and town hall in Kostyantynivka. Reuters journalists saw about 20 well-organized gunmen controlling the administration building. They erected a barricade of tires, sandbags and concrete blocks.\n\nSoviet songs played over loudspeakers, and women gathered signatures in support of an uprising against rule from Kiev.\n\nKharkiv Mayor Gennady Kernes, a colorful and well-known figure nationwide, was shot in the back while out exercising, and doctors are battling to save his life. Kernes, 54, is a member of the party through which Yanukovich and fellow easterners had dominated a Ukrainian system widely seen as deeply corrupt.\n\nAmong the most prominent Jewish politicians in the country who earned his wealth from business dealings in the crime-ridden 1990s, Kernes had called for Kharkiv to quit Ukraine after Yanukovich fell, but had lately clamped down on separatists. The government said police were looking into whether the assassination attempt was linked to the arrest of pro-Russian separatists on Sunday.\n\nAlthough Russia signed a deal with Ukraine and Kiev's U.S. and EU allies at Geneva 10 days ago under which militants should surrender to OSCE monitors, it flatly denies Ukrainian and Western assertions it is controlling the militants' activities and that it has special forces orchestrating events on the ground.\n\n\"Russia's involvement in the recent violence in eastern Ukraine is indisputable,\" a White House statement said.\n\nAfter an appeal from Germany, long Moscow's firmest advocate in the West, for Russia to intervene to secure the release of the seven European monitors, four of whom are German, Moscow's ambassador to the OSCE said it would be good if they were freed.\n\nBut he also condemned the OSCE, of which Russia is a member, for being \"extremely irresponsible\" in sending them to eastern Ukraine. Moscow has condemned the Kiev authorities for failing to provide security in the industrial and heavily populated east, close to the Russian border.\n\nIn the face of Western and Ukrainian calls for it to pull back troops massed on Ukraine's frontier, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Monday it had \"deep concern\" about forces Kiev has sent to the region, suggesting that Ukrainian troops might be preparing for \"the destruction of entire cities\".\n\nIn the separatist military stronghold at Slaviansk, the self-declared mayor, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, said he had given OSCE mediators a list of detainees his movement wanted freed by Kiev in return for the OSCE observers he is holding.\n\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry said the jailed leader of an earlier separatist protest in Donetsk was on hunger strike to protest against his torture. It also cited reports that Ukraine was building detention centers \"very reminiscent of Nazi concentration camps\" for \"dissenting citizens\" in the east.\n\nThe Moscow stock market shrugged off the sanctions, rising almost 1 percent when they failed to penalize more companies.\n\nAlthough its chief executive, Sechin, was hit by a visa ban, few expected Rosneft or its international partners to suffer much, though its shares lost 1.7 percent on the day.\n\nWestern countries say sanctions are already having an effect on Russia by scaring investors into pulling out capital. The central bank has raised interest rates to support the ruble, and Russian firms are finding it harder to raise funds.",

                        "text": "A letter obtained by Reuters which was sent to several U.N. Security Council members this month by international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working in Syria says a lack of coordination by the United Nations means assistance is not reaching some civilians in priority areas.\n\nIn other regions of the country the U.N. does not inform other aid groups when it brings aid, leading to \"potential duplication\" of deliveries, the document said.\n\nSyria's war has killed 150,000 people and poses an enormous challenge for relief workers. Nine million people inside the country need aid and protection, industry and agriculture are failing, and 2.5 million refugees have fled abroad.\n\nFunding shortfalls combined with restrictions imposed by Damascus and by the fighting have hampered relief efforts.\n\nBut the NGOs suggested that shortcomings in the aid operations were aggravating the situation, calling on the United Nations to demonstrate greater leadership, improve coordination and demand better access.\n\nU.N. officials in New York, Geneva and Damascus declined to comment on the NGO report, but U.N. emergency relief coordinator Valerie Amos has repeatedly said the Syrian government and rebels have not done enough to allow aid in to besieged areas.\n\nPresident Bashar al-Assad's forces and to a lesser extent rebels fighting to overthrow him have been accused of preventing food and medicine from reaching a quarter of a million people in besieged areas, seeking to starve opponents into submission.\n\nSyrian authorities also frequently dictate how aid is distributed by U.N. agencies, who are legally obliged to work with the country's authorities, resulting in more supplies going to government-controlled areas, aid workers say.\n\nSeeking to expand the humanitarian reach, the U.N. Security Council agreed in February that all sides must allow greater access. But U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said last week none of Syria's warring parties was adhering to the demand.\n\nReuters spoke to three international aid organization that drafted the report to Security Council members. The organizations asked to remain anonymous, citing fears that public disclosure would negatively affect their work in Syria.\n\n\"U.N. agencies ... need to ensure better coordination and leadership,\" the report said.\n\n\"Coordination between aid agencies operating from neighboring countries and those present in Damascus continues to be challenging, with weak U.N. systems and insufficient capacity currently in place.\n\n\"In Damascus, NGOs are often excluded from decision-making processes related to the planning of aid convoys and discussions on aid delivery mechanisms,\" it said.\n\nThe report said aid groups did not take part in a government and U.N. meetings during the evacuation of civilians from besieged areas of Homs city this year. That kind of exclusion means \"that information and analysis from a broader range of aid actors are often not taken on board,\" it said.\n\n\"Greater U.N. action to press for diplomatic support on key access issues is needed,\" it added, repeating a long-standing criticism that the U.N. has not voiced concerns loud enough when Syrian authorities impede access, such as restricting aid to besieged areas.\n\nAmos, who is due to brief the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday, has appealed to the council for more than a year for help in increasing humanitarian access.\n\nDiplomats say that it will be tough, however, for the council to take further action. Russia, supported by China, has shielded its ally Syria on the Security Council during the war. They had previously vetoed three resolutions that would have condemned Syria's government and threatened it with possible sanctions.\n\nA representative of an international NGO that works in Syria and neighboring countries said the U.N. \"should complement ongoing operations, not undermine them.\"\n\n\"That's a concern at the moment, that a lack of coordination between the U.N. and organizations already working on the ground means they're sometimes doing more harm than good,\" he said.\n\n\"Ban Ki-moon's recent report (on aid access) was strong, but frustratingly it barely mentioned the challenges that NGOs have faced in delivering aid cross border and cross line in Syria.\"\n\nThe report, dated April 16, said U.N. agencies are not directly providing critical humanitarian support to millions of Syrians across borders, one of the main demands which the Security Council resolution put to Syrian authorities.\n\nOn March 20, U.N. aid trucks crossed from Turkey into Syria for the first time. But the report said the operation \"allowed virtually no assistance to reach civilians in opposition-controlled areas\".\n\nIt said that delays in sharing U.N. plans meant that aid during the cross-border operation was duplicated as other humanitarian groups were also distributing there.\n\nThere are eight formal border crossings between Syria and Turkey and the one used, Qamishli, is the only one where there are government forces in the area. Damascus has made clear it will not allow crossings through rebel-held border posts.\n\n\"We need the help of the U.N. to really scale up that operation and meet the huge demand for help. There are 7 million people living in areas that can only really be accessed with any ease from border countries,\" the representative said.",

                        "text": "1 of 9. Pro-Russian protesters take part in a rally near the seized office of the SBU state security service in Luhansk, eastern Ukraine, April 27, 2014.\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama called for the United States and Europe to join forces to impose stronger measures to restrain Moscow. The White House said it will add names on Monday of people close to President Vladimir Putin and firms they control to a list of Russians hit by sanctions over Ukraine, and also impose new restrictions on high tech exports.\n\nThe European Union is expected to follow suit by adding to its own list of targeted Russian people and firms, but Washington and Brussels have yet to reach agreement on wider measures designed to hurt the Russian economy more broadly.\n\nIn Donetsk, where pro-Russian rebels have proclaimed an independent \"people's republic\", armed fighters seized the headquarters of regional television and ordered it to start broadcasting a Russian state TV channel.\n\nSpeaking during a visit to Malaysia, Obama said restraining Russian President Vladimir Putin's ambitions in Ukraine would depend on the United States and its allies finding a unified position on tighter sanctions.\n\n\"We're going to be in a stronger position to deter Mr. Putin when he sees that the world is unified and the United States and Europe is unified rather than this is just a U.S.-Russian conflict,\" Obama told reporters.\n\nWhite House deputy national security adviser Tony Blinken said the new U.S. measures would be imposed on Monday, mostly focused on adding to a list of those barred from travel to the United States and hit by asset freezes.\n\n\"We will be looking to designate people who are in (Putin's) inner circle, who have a significant impact on the Russian economy. We'll be looking to designate companies that they and other inner circle people control,\" Blinken told CBS television.\n\n\"We'll be looking at taking steps, as well, with regard to high-technology exports to their defense industry. All of this together is going to have an impact.\"\n\nThe stand-off over Ukraine, an ex-Soviet republic of about 45 million people, has dragged relations between Russia and the West to their lowest level since the end of the Cold War.\n\nAfter Ukrainians overthrew a pro-Russian president, Putin overturned decades of international diplomacy last month by announcing the right to use military force on his neighbor's territory. He has seized and annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and massed tens of thousands of troops on the frontier.\n\nHeavily armed pro-Russian gunmen have seized buildings in towns and cities across eastern Ukraine. Kiev and its Western allies say the uprising is directed by Russian agents. Moscow denies it is involved and says the uprising is a spontaneous reaction to oppression of Russian speakers by Kiev.\n\nAn international agreement reached this month calls on rebels to vacate occupied buildings, but Obama said Russia had not \"lifted a finger\" to push its allies to comply.\n\n\"In fact, there's strong evidence that they've been encouraging the activities in eastern and southern Ukraine.\"\n\nThe Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe has sent unarmed monitors to try to encourage compliance with the peace deal. The pro-Russian rebels seized eight European monitors three days ago and have been holding them at their most heavily-fortified redoubt in the town of Slaviansk.\n\nOne, a Swede, was permitted to leave on Sunday after OSCE negotiators arrived to discuss their release. A separatist spokeswoman said the prisoner had been let go on medical grounds, but there were no plans to free the rest.\n\nThe captives, from Germany, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Poland and Sweden, were paraded before reporters on Sunday and said they were in good health.\n\n\"We have no indication when we will be sent home to our countries,\" the group's leader, German Colonel Axel Schneider, told reporters as armed men in camouflage fatigues and balaclavas looked on. \"We wish from the bottom of our hearts to go back to our nations as soon and as quickly as possible.\"\n\nGermany denounced the appearance and said Moscow must press their captors to free the prisoners.\n\n\"The public parading of the OSCE observers and Ukrainian security forces as prisoners is revolting and blatantly hurts the dignity of the victims,\" Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said in a statement.\n\n\"It is an infringement of every rule of behavior and standards that are made for tense situations like this. Russia has a duty to influence the separatists so that the detained members of the OSCE mission are freed as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe OSCE, a European security body, includes Russia. Its main Ukraine mission was approved by Moscow, although the Europeans held in Slaviansk were on a separate OSCE-authorized mission that did not require Russia's consent.\n\nVyacheslav Ponomaryov, the rebel leader who has declared himself mayor of Slaviansk, has described them as prisoners of war and said the separatists were prepared to exchange them for fellow rebels in Ukrainian custody.\n\nWashington is more hawkish on further sanctions than some of its European allies, which has caused a degree of impatience among some U.S. officials. Many European countries are worried about the risks of imposing tougher sanctions - the EU has more than 10 times as much trade with Russia as the United States and imports about a quarter of its natural gas from Russia.\n\nAt the Donetsk television headquarters, about 400 pro-Russian demonstrators chanted \"Russia! Russia!\" and \"Referendum!\" - a call for a vote like one in Crimea that preceded its annexation by Russia last month. Four separatists in masks controlled access at the entrance, and more masked gunmen in camouflage fatigues could be seen inside.\n\nOleg Dzholos, the station's director, who came outside to speak to reporters, said the people who seized the building had ordered him to change the programming.\n\n\"They used force to push back the gates,\" he said. \"There were no threats. There were not many of my people. What can a few people do? The leaders of this movement just gave me an ultimatum that one of the Russian channels has to be broadcast.\"\n\nPonomaryov, the rebel leader in Slaviansk, said his men had captured three officers with Ukraine's state security service who, he said, had been mounting an operation against separatists in the nearby town of Horlivka.\n\nThe Russian television station Rossiya 24 showed footage it said was of a colonel, a major and a captain. They were shown seated, with their hands behind their backs, blindfolded, and wearing no trousers. At least two had bruises on their faces.\n\nUkraine's State Security Service said the three had been part of a unit which went to Horlivka to arrest a suspect in the murder of Volodymyr Rybak, a pro-Kiev councillor whose body was found last week in a river near Slaviansk.",

                        "text": "The decision, which contradicted the conciliatory tone set by Putin just a day earlier, caused consternation in the West, which fears the referendum will tear Ukraine apart.\n\nU.S. Deputy Secretary of State William Burns said Russia was heading down a \"dangerous and irresponsible path\" and the situation in Ukraine was \"extremely combustible\".\n\nDenis Pushilin, a leader of the self-declared separatist Donetsk People's Republic, expressed gratitude to Putin but said the \"People's Council\" had voted unanimously on Thursday to hold the plebiscite as planned.\n\n\"Civil war has already begun,\" he told reporters. \"The referendum can put a stop to it and start a political process.\" A man holding a Kalashnikov stood behind him.\n\nPolitical analysts said Putin may have expected the rebels to go ahead with the referendum, showing that they were not under his orders. By distancing himself from a process that will not be recognized by the West, Putin may also hope to avoid further sanctions as earlier measures begin hitting the economy.\n\nHis spokesman said the Kremlin needed more information about the rebels' decision. He also said the rebel statement came only after the Western-backed government in Kiev had declared it would press on with its military operation, implying that Ukraine was to blame for the rebels' refusal to heed Putin.\n\nRussian financial markets sank after surging on Wednesday when Putin unexpectedly called for the vote to be delayed and declared that troops were withdrawing from Ukraine's border.\n\nNATO and the United States both said they saw no sign of a Russian withdrawal from the frontier.\n\nWhen NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen tweeted as much, the Russian Foreign Ministry tweeted back that \"those with a blind eye\" should read Putin's statement.\n\nNATO has accused Moscow of using special forces in the separatist takeover of mainly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine after annexing Crimea from Ukraine in March.\n\nPutin acknowledged his troops were active in Crimea after initially denying any role there but says they are not involved in eastern Ukraine, a densely populated steel and coal belt responsible for roughly a third of Ukraine's industrial output.\n\nAbout 40 armed men attacked a Ukrainian border post on the Russian frontier on Thursday and tried to seize it, but were beaten off by Ukrainian forces, the border guard in Kiev said.\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk said Putin's conciliatory remarks made him suspect Moscow was planning some form of \"skirmish\" to discredit Kiev when the country celebrates Victory Day on Friday.\n\nUkraine had tightened security for the May 9 anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945, Yatseniuk said.\n\nRussian state TV has portrayed Ukraine'e pro-Western government as fascists, and Yatseniuk said he feared Moscow would stage an incident involving veterans who fought with the Soviet army in defeating the Nazis.\n\n\"There is no doubt about this ... and Russian television will show footage of rampant nationalists beating up veterans. Russian propaganda,\" he told \"Fifth Channel\" television, quoted by Interfax-Ukraine.\n\nPutin's call to delay the referendum, followed so quickly by the rebel decision to go ahead with it, have complicated U.S. and European efforts to agree a common policy that might lead to tighter economic sanctions on Russia.\n\nThe European Union said shortly before the referendum announcement that the plebiscite \"would have no democratic legitimacy and could only further worsen the situation\".\n\nThe EU has laid the groundwork for possible sanctions against Russian companies, including energy giants, over Ukraine and diplomats said they could decide which on Monday, but that, if any, they would only be those linked to Crimea.\n\nLast month's U.S. and Canadian sanctions were tougher than the EU's and Moscow said on Thursday it had retaliated by expanding the list of U.S. and Canadian officials barred from Russia but would not give details.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry discussed by phone on Thursday joint efforts to defuse the crisis, which also involve the EU and OSCE European security organization, the Foreign Ministry in Moscow said.\n\nIn Washington, the State Department said Kerry had also spoken to Yatseniuk, who proposed with Ukraine's interim president the creation of a \"Round Table\" to resolve the conflict. This would draw in political forces and civil groups in all regions, with international mediators asked to help.\n\nThe mediators took their peace proposals to Kiev on Thursday. The draft \"road map\", seen by Reuters, takes no direct view on the referendum but said national elections planned by the Kiev leadership for May 25 were vital to stabilizing the country.\n\nUkraine's Foreign Ministry said the plan, drawn up by the Swiss chair of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe had \"some common ground\" with its own proposals.\n\nThe referendum has become seen as a vital step by many in Ukraine's industrial east, fired up over what the rebels, and Moscow, call the \"fascist\" government in Kiev that took over after street protests ousted a pro-Moscow president in February.\n\n\"You have no idea how many armed people there are in Donetsk right now,\" Roman Lyagin, the 33-year-old head of the self-proclaimed republic's election commission, told Reuters at his headquarters behind barricades of tyres and car bumpers in the occupied regional administration in Donetsk.\n\n\"There is no man who can move this referendum,\" he said.\n\nBallots, printed in Donetsk, have been distributed across the rebel zone, smuggled through Ukrainian army checkpoints. Lyagin says more than three million people are eligible to vote.\n\nArtyom, a rebel at a roadblock in the rebel-held eastern town of Slaviansk, said of the referendum decision: \"This is great news. We need to have our say.\"\n\nWhile many Russian speakers in Ukraine fear discrimination under the new leadership, the extent of support for the separatists - many of whom say their ultimate aim is to join Russia - is not so clear. Opinion polls say a majority wish to remain in Ukraine, but with a far greater degree of autonomy.\n\nPutin said his call for the vote's postponement would open the way to negotiations on cooling down a crisis that has led to dozens of deaths in clashes between troops and separatists in eastern Ukraine and rival groups in the southern port of Odessa.\n\nOn Thursday he again blamed Kiev, saying its \"irresponsible politics\" had caused the crisis while in the Ukrainian capital, officials said the government would not talk to \"terrorists\" - their word for the separatists.\n\nMaria Lipman, an expert at the Carnegie Center think-tank in Moscow, said Putin would have known that his request for the referendum to be postponed would be rebuffed.\n\n\"But this can be used to show that the people in Ukraine's east are not Russians, take no orders from Russia, that Russia exercises no control over them because they only do what they want to do,\" she said. \"He has also distanced Russia from the referendum, which has a completely unclear status and will not be recognized by the West.\"\n\nWestern leaders have threatened more sanctions if the presidential election on May 25 is disrupted. Putin said on Wednesday it was \"a step in the right direction\"; on Thursday, Lavrov said the election would be \"senseless\" if Kiev did not end its military operation against the separatists.",

Not only was its president, Igor Sechin, singled out in the US blacklist, but also Sergei Chemezov, a member of the board who also directs a state-owned holding company.\n\nLike other Russian energy firms, Rosneft has deep ties with American-based counterparts, particularly ExxonMobil, with whom it has a $500m joint venture for exploration of Arctic oil. The British oil giant, BP, also owns a nearly 20% stake in Rosneft, but said on Monday it intends to remain a long-term investor in Russia, despite the new sanctions.\n\nRussian officials vowed to take reprisal measures for the American sanctions package. \u201cWe are certain that this response will have a painful effect on Washington,\u201d deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov told the Interfax news agency.\n\nThe Obama administration indicated it believes it is more likely to influence Russian behaviour through economic pressure than providing additional and potentially lethal military aid to Ukraine, citing the massive discrepancy in Ukrainian and Russian military capabilities.\n\nLast week, a contingent of US soldiers from the 173rd infantry combat team arrived in a Polish air base, part of a commitment of 600 troops the administration will send to Poland and the Baltic states on a so-called training mission that the White House hopes will have a deterrent value.\n\nFraud investigators in Britain also froze $23m of suspected dirty money held in the UK, as they opened an investigation into possible money laundering from Ukraine, mostly by members of the ousted regime of Viktor Yanukovych.\n\nThe announcement of a criminal investigation by the Serious Fraud Office comes on the eve of an international conference in London aimed at helping Ukraine\u2019s new government recover stolen assets. The two-day Ukraine Forum on Asset Recovery, organised by the Foreign Office and the US attorney general, brings together investigating organisations to work on recovering millions in stolen assets.\n\nRobert Barrington, executive director of Transparency International in the UK, said the $23m of suspected stolen money the SFO was looking at could be a tiny proportion of the total money embezzled by corrupt officials in Ukraine. \u201cOne would hope this would be the first announcement on a very long journey.\u201d\n\nGovernments were working much faster to recover stolen assets than after the Arab Spring, he said. But questions persist about the UK\u2019s legal framework for checking on stolen money. \u201cWhy was the money here in the first place? If if was corrupt it should never have been here.\u201d\n\nLast month the EU froze assets of former president Yanukovych, and 21 other people held responsible for embezzling state funds.",

Along with the other case, in which 683 have been sentenced to death for killing a policeman, it forms the latest instalment of a government crackdown during which at least 16,000 people have been arrested and more than 2,500 killed since the ousting of Morsi.</p><p>Prosecutors say the defendants in both cases are Brotherhood members who  killed two police officers during nationwide violence last August. The 529 defendants are accused of lynching a policeman in Matay, a town in Minya province, southern Egypt. On the same day, 683 others \u2013 including the Brotherhood's Badie \u2013 are said to have killed another officer in the nearby town of Adwa.</p><p>But many of the defendants in both trials say they were neither present during the attacks, nor supporters of the Brotherhood. In some cases, they say they were not even in the province itself \u2013 and that they were reported to the police by informants acting on personal agendas.</p><p>Both verdicts would have been reached after just two court sessions in which defence lawyers said there was no time to assess thousands of pages of testimonies and court documents.</p><p>\"There is nothing against me \u2013 no one has any evidence that I was there on that day,\" said Hagag Saber, a 34-year-old government electrician who is one of the 683 sentenced to death for the killing in Adwa. Currently at large, he claims he was in Cairo on the day of the attacks.</p><p>\"There is no justice or integrity, nothing based on facts. Everything is based on an illegitimate investigation that took hearsay from people in the street,\" he said.</p><p>Saber's lawyer, Mohamed Abd-El Fatah Ali, said the judge \u2013 Saeed Youssef, who presided over both cases \u2013 could not have had time to read the thousands of pages of court documents relating to the case.</p><p>\"There's no human who could read this amount of newspaper pages, let alone legal documents containing testimonies, in order to find the paragraph that relates to this case and these defendants in the time allowed,\" said Ali. \"That would take three months.\"</p><p>Families have alleged that some defendants are not even mentioned in the documents.</p><p>One of Ali's colleagues, Ahmed Eid, was arrested because of personal differences with local policemen, his family has claimed. Previously a lawyer in the 529-strong case, Eid joined his clients in jail after the case had officially been referred to court.

                        "text": "More than 1,200 men face the death sentence in Egypt, as a judge deliberates on whether to uphold the sentences he gave 529 defendants in March.\n\nThe leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Mohamed Badie, whose colleague Mohamed Morsi was removed from Egypt's presidency last July, is among the defendants in one of two mass trials.\n\nAmnesty International has said the case of the 529 men is the largest batch of simultaneous death sentences in living memory. Along with the other case, in which 683 have been sentenced to death for killing a policeman, it forms the latest instalment of a government crackdown during which at least 16,000 people have been arrested and more than 2,500 killed since the ousting of Morsi.\n\nProsecutors say the defendants in both cases are Brotherhood members who killed two police officers during nationwide violence last August. The 529 defendants are accused of lynching a policeman in Matay, a town in Minya province, southern Egypt. On the same day, 683 others \u2013 including the Brotherhood's Badie \u2013 are said to have killed another officer in the nearby town of Adwa.\n\nBut many of the defendants in both trials say they were neither present during the attacks, nor supporters of the Brotherhood. In some cases, they say they were not even in the province itself \u2013 and that they were reported to the police by informants acting on personal agendas.\n\nBoth verdicts would have been reached after just two court sessions in which defence lawyers said there was no time to assess thousands of pages of testimonies and court documents.\n\n\"There is nothing against me \u2013 no one has any evidence that I was there on that day,\" said Hagag Saber, a 34-year-old government electrician who is one of the 683 sentenced to death for the killing in Adwa. Currently at large, he claims he was in Cairo on the day of the attacks.\n\n\"There is no justice or integrity, nothing based on facts. Everything is based on an illegitimate investigation that took hearsay from people in the street,\" he said.\n\nSaber's lawyer, Mohamed Abd-El Fatah Ali, said the judge \u2013 Saeed Youssef, who presided over both cases \u2013 could not have had time to read the thousands of pages of court documents relating to the case.\n\n\"There's no human who could read this amount of newspaper pages, let alone legal documents containing testimonies, in order to find the paragraph that relates to this case and these defendants in the time allowed,\" said Ali. \"That would take three months.\"\n\nFamilies have alleged that some defendants are not even mentioned in the documents.\n\nOne of Ali's colleagues, Ahmed Eid, was arrested because of personal differences with local policemen, his family has claimed. Previously a lawyer in the 529-strong case, Eid joined his clients in jail after the case had officially been referred to court. His wife said police arrested him because he had failed to pay them a bribe, and that investigators \u2013 with whom he was in daily contact on behalf of his clients \u2013 had never previously suggested he was involved in the case.\n\nThe sentences were reached despite an international campaign in which more than 1.5 million people signed a petition hosted by online activists Avaaz that called for a commuting of the sentences.\n\nBut in Egypt the outcry has not been universal. Many see the 529 death sentences as a fitting revenge on the Brotherhood, who are blamed for a wave of militancy across Egypt in recent months.\n\n\"The outrage over the conviction of 529 terrorists is in itself an outrage,\" said one commentator in a state-run newspaper this month.\n\nAfter the initial sentences on the 529 in March, Egypt's foreign ministry released a statement defending the court's integrity. The verdict was announced in the separate mass trial of the other 683. \"The sentence was issued by an independent court after careful study of the case,\" the statement read.",

But who does Putin go to? Is it Angela Merkel or Barack Obama? Or perhaps Catherine Ashton? Or John Kerry or William Hague or Herman Van Rompuy?</p><p>Putin's central control contrasts with western fragmentation, incoherence, and equivocation.</p><p>\"Putin is continuing to pursue the strategy of indirect, proxy destabilisation in order to achieve his goals. This latest apparent feint appears at best a tactic to diminish the costs of pursuing this strategy,\" said the Eurasia Group on Thursday.</p><p>To listen to the Russian foreign ministry or watch Russian television in recent weeks is to get a picture of a Ukraine riven between Soviet nostalgics in the east pining for 1970s Mother Russia and terrified of antisemitic fascists from Kiev and the those in the west who long for a Europe of the 1930s.</p><p>The caricature has been assiduously cultivated to manufacture ethnic, linguistic and cultural tensions between east and west which may have been latent but were quite manageable under responsible political leadership.</p><p>Slobodan Milosevic performed precisely this trick in the 1990s in Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, and Kosovo.

                        "text": "Vladimir Putin acts, and the west (sometimes) reacts. That has been the pattern of the Ukraine crisis since it erupted into an open contest between Russia and the west last November.\n\nAt every stage, whether through poor intelligence, policy shambles or divisions in Europe and with America, the west has been caught napping, while the Kremlin called the shots.\n\nPutin has been winning all the battles, although it does not necessarily mean he will win the war.\n\nPutin ordered the ditching of Ukraine's political and trade pacts with the EU; he annexed Crimea; he sowed chaos, violence, and secessionism in the east; he left Kiev looking incapable of running, controlling or defending Ukraine.\n\nThe Russian leader's sudden volte-face on Wednesday, calling for separatist referendums in eastern Ukraine to be shelved and sounding sanguine for the first time about Ukraine's presidential election slated for this month, has again caught the west napping and brought rewards.\n\nPutin has reinforced Europe's split between hawks and doves, between those calling for \"proper\" economic and trade sanctions and those quickly seduced into giving Russia the benefit of the doubt.\n\nHaving created chaos he can still probably control, Putin has stepped back, appearing moderate and conciliatory while still able to pull the levers of destabilisation at will.\n\nHe has avoided for now the imposition of sweeping European sanctions that would hit Russia hard.\n\nHe has made himself indispensable to any settlement, meaning that his terms for a new Ukraine constitution \u2013 far-reaching federalisation that enfeebles the central government in Kiev and allows him to pull the strings in the east of the country \u2013 will need to be given a hearing.\n\nFor western would-be mediators, Putin is the one to go to. But who does Putin go to? Is it Angela Merkel or Barack Obama? Or perhaps Catherine Ashton? Or John Kerry or William Hague or Herman Van Rompuy?\n\n\"Putin is continuing to pursue the strategy of indirect, proxy destabilisation in order to achieve his goals. This latest apparent feint appears at best a tactic to diminish the costs of pursuing this strategy,\" said the Eurasia Group on Thursday.\n\nTo listen to the Russian foreign ministry or watch Russian television in recent weeks is to get a picture of a Ukraine riven between Soviet nostalgics in the east pining for 1970s Mother Russia and terrified of antisemitic fascists from Kiev and the those in the west who long for a Europe of the 1930s.\n\nThe caricature has been assiduously cultivated to manufacture ethnic, linguistic and cultural tensions between east and west which may have been latent but were quite manageable under responsible political leadership.\n\nSlobodan Milosevic performed precisely this trick in the 1990s in Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, and Kosovo. It is in this respect \u2013 the calculated manufacture of tension, hatred, and conflict \u2013 that Ukraine now resembles Bosnia, although there are ample differences.\n\nA Pew opinion poll on Thursday highlighted a much more benign Ukraine than the one sighted on Russian TV.\n\nOnly 14% of respondents favoured allowing secessionism, while 70% in eastern Ukraine wanted to retain a single country. There was no appreciable dislike between ethnic Russians and ethnic Ukrainians. Two-thirds of Ukrainians deplored Putin's influence on Ukraine while one fifth thought it favourable.\n\nAmong Ukraine's Russian-speakers, outside Crimea, a minority, 41%, supported Russia's role in Ukraine.\n\nThat suggests another reason, perhaps, why Putin called for Sunday's eastern referendum to be shelved: short of massive rigging, he will probably lose it.",

Despite the apparent \"tactical retreat\" of his appeal for a postponed referendum, Putin did not back down from saying he \"understands\" the armed groups in south-east Ukraine, or from accusing the west and Kiev of exacerbating the crisis.\n\nReporter: What concrete steps can you take, because experts all say that Moscow holds the key to resolving the conflict. How can you influence people in eastern Ukraine, the so-called separatists?\n\nPutin: First, the idea that Russia holds the key to resolving the problem is a trick thought up by our western partners, and does not have any grounds in reality. No sooner do our colleagues in Europe or the US drive the situation into a dead end, they always say that Moscow holds the keys.\n\nThe responsibility for what is happening in Ukraine now lies with the people who carried out an anti-constitutional seizure of power, a coup d\u2019etat, and with those who supported [them] \u2026 and pushed the situation to the tragic events that took place in Odessa. It\u2019s quite simply blood-chilling to watch the footage of those events.\n\nI can understand the people in south-east Ukraine, who say that if others can do what they like in Kiev, carry out a coup, take up arms and seize government buildings, police stations and military garrisons, then why shouldn\u2019t they be allowed to defend their interests and lawful rights?",

At some point during the melee he was badly beaten and died in intensive care in a local hospital the following day.</p><p>The other funeral was of Maksim Nikitenko, 31, who was also killed early on during the struggle inside the trade union building. \"They fought and cracked open his skull and then he was thrown out of the window,\" said Petya, a friend.</p><p>Nikitenko was not a separatist or an extremist, but he ran to defend the trade union building when he heard it was under attack, Petya added.</p><p>Before the burials Markin's open casket lay in the local parliament building for friends, colleagues and residents of Odessa to pay their last respects.</p><p>Outside an angry crowd gathered and the regional governor, who had come to lay flowers, was assaulted and forced to flee ignominiously down a corridor. When pallbearers carried the coffin out of the building people clapped and chanted \"Odessa is a Russian city\", \"Hero, hero, hero!\" and \"Odessa will not forgive nor forget\".</p><p>The Ukrainian interior ministry said on Monday morning that 42 people detained during the violence had been transferred to other parts of the country. The move came after an angry mob forced police to release over 60 detainees on Sunday. Interior minister Arsen Avakov also said that a special forces battalion had been transferred to the city to help keep order.</p><p>The Ukrainian government has said that the violence was initiated by Russian provocateurs, while <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\" title=\"More from the Guardian on Russia\">Russia</a> has referred to the deaths \u2013 many of which were caused by a fire that broke out inside the building \u2013 as a massacre inspired by \"neo-Nazis\".

                        "text": "Four Ukrainian soldiers have been killed and at least 30 injured, according to officials, in clashes with separatists as the army attempted to regain control of eastern Ukraine. There was fighting at a number of points on the outskirts of Slavyansk on Monday, the base of the armed movement that has taken over a number of cities.\n\nThe separatists also reported deaths in the fighting \u2013 although exact figures were impossible to verify \u2013 and a military helicopter was shot down although both pilots survived, according to the defence ministry.\n\nThe self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic plans to hold a referendum on independence on Sunday, with much of the region outside Kiev's control.\n\nAs well as the clashes in the east, the fallout from the violence and fatal fire late last week in the southern city of Odessa continued to be felt on Monday.\n\nUnder a leaden sky at the edge of a cemetery in Odessa, family and friends laid to rest Vladimir Markin, a local politician who was killed in the vicious street battles that convulsed the city last week.\n\nA short distance away the funeral of another man who died fighting pro-Ukrainian crowds was also taking place.\n\nThe burials were the first of dozens that will take place over the next few weeks as the port city struggles to come to terms with Ukraine's most violent day since the new regime swept to power in February.\n\nMarkin, 44, was a key supporter of a semi-permanent protest camp in Odessa against the current Kiev government that was burned to the ground on Friday before fighting moved to the nearby trade union building. At some point during the melee he was badly beaten and died in intensive care in a local hospital the following day.\n\nThe other funeral was of Maksim Nikitenko, 31, who was also killed early on during the struggle inside the trade union building. \"They fought and cracked open his skull and then he was thrown out of the window,\" said Petya, a friend.\n\nNikitenko was not a separatist or an extremist, but he ran to defend the trade union building when he heard it was under attack, Petya added.\n\nBefore the burials Markin's open casket lay in the local parliament building for friends, colleagues and residents of Odessa to pay their last respects.\n\nOutside an angry crowd gathered and the regional governor, who had come to lay flowers, was assaulted and forced to flee ignominiously down a corridor. When pallbearers carried the coffin out of the building people clapped and chanted \"Odessa is a Russian city\", \"Hero, hero, hero!\" and \"Odessa will not forgive nor forget\".\n\nThe Ukrainian interior ministry said on Monday morning that 42 people detained during the violence had been transferred to other parts of the country. The move came after an angry mob forced police to release over 60 detainees on Sunday. Interior minister Arsen Avakov also said that a special forces battalion had been transferred to the city to help keep order.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has said that the violence was initiated by Russian provocateurs, while Russia has referred to the deaths \u2013 many of which were caused by a fire that broke out inside the building \u2013 as a massacre inspired by \"neo-Nazis\". The horrific events have only served to worsen an already tense situation.\n\nSupporters of closer ties with Russia, who made up the majority of the mourners, blame the government in Kiev \u2013 which they describe as a \"junta\" and illegitimate, mirroring Russian state propaganda about the Ukrainian authorities \u2013 for the deaths last week. They accuse the police of failing to act swiftly enough to stop the violence.\n\nUkraine has accused Russia of directing the separatists, providing weapons and using proxy figures on the ground. Most analysts think Russia does not want a Crimea-style annexation of eastern Ukraine, but merely to stir up discontent and disrupt elections at the end of May.\n\nIn recent days President Vladimir Putin has made no public statements about the situation, but the Russian foreign ministry again pinned the blame on Kiev in a statement on Monday evening.\n\n\"The so-called authorities in Kiev continue to wage war against the people of their own country,\" said the ministry, adding there was a \"humanitarian catastrophe\" brewing in the east of the country and calling on Kiev to \"stop the bloodshed\".\n\nUkrainian authorities have likewise repeatedly called on Russia to stop stirring unrest in the region, as accusations continue to fly between the two countries.\n\nGermany said on Monday it was pushing for a fresh set of diplomatic talks in Geneva between Russia, Ukraine, the EU and US, to push for a return to the accord reached last month that encouraged all sides to put down their weapons.\n\nForeign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said new talks were needed to reach a \"clear conclusion as to how this conflict can be brought to a halt\".\n\nIn eastern Ukraine surveys show the vast majority of people want more autonomy from Kiev but only a minority want to join Russia. However, the mood has turned nastier in the last week, with crowds burning Ukrainian flags, and many speaking about a \"point of no return\".\n\nIn Odessa 52-year-old Igor Bulatov, an engineer who attended the funerals, said that while there were few separatists among current pro-Russian protesters, the deaths last week might change that. \"I came to pay my respects to people who were murdered \u2026 when you kill people for their ideas it is fascism,\" he said.\n\n\"Recent events mean a lot of people are now wondering about what country they want to live in.

The television report identified the hotel as the Carlton, next to the city's ancient citadel.</p><p>A local activist group called the Sham News Network also reported the blast, saying President <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/bashar-al-assad\" title=\"More from the Guardian on Bashar al-Assad\">Bashar al-Assad</a>'s troops were based in the hotel.</p><p>Another activist group, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said the explosion had struck a government-held district in Aleppo's Old City, next to rebel positions. The Observatory said the rebels belonging to the Islamic Front group had planted a huge amount of explosives in a tunnel they dug below the Carlton hotel, detonating it remotely.</p><p>It said the hotel was completely destroyed in the blast and there were casualties among the troops.</p><p>Aleppo, the country's largest city and former commercial hub, has been carved up into rebel-held and government-held areas since the rebels launched an offensive there in mid-2010, capturing territory along Syria's northern border with Turkey.</p><p>In recent months, government aircraft have relentlessly bombed rebel-held areas of the city. Opposition fighters have hit back, firing mortars into government-held areas. The rebels have also detonated car bombs in residential areas, killing dozens of people.</p><p>Meanwhile, more rebels are expected to leave the central city of Homs as the evacuation of opposition fighters moves into its second day. Homs is Syria's third largest city and has been known as the capital of anti-Assad revolution since the uprising against his rule erupted in March 2011.</p><p>The Homs governor Talal Barazi told Syrian state TV late on Wednesday that the evacuation process was being conducted in a \"positive atmosphere\".

                        "text": "A \"huge explosion\" in northern Syria has levelled a hotel that government troops used as a military base, along with several other buildings in a government-held area, state television and activists reported.\n\nSyrian state television said the explosion on Thursday had struck on the edge of a contested old neighbourhood in Aleppo. The television report identified the hotel as the Carlton, next to the city's ancient citadel.\n\nA local activist group called the Sham News Network also reported the blast, saying President Bashar al-Assad's troops were based in the hotel.\n\nAnother activist group, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said the explosion had struck a government-held district in Aleppo's Old City, next to rebel positions. The Observatory said the rebels belonging to the Islamic Front group had planted a huge amount of explosives in a tunnel they dug below the Carlton hotel, detonating it remotely.\n\nIt said the hotel was completely destroyed in the blast and there were casualties among the troops.\n\nAleppo, the country's largest city and former commercial hub, has been carved up into rebel-held and government-held areas since the rebels launched an offensive there in mid-2010, capturing territory along Syria's northern border with Turkey.\n\nIn recent months, government aircraft have relentlessly bombed rebel-held areas of the city. Opposition fighters have hit back, firing mortars into government-held areas. The rebels have also detonated car bombs in residential areas, killing dozens of people.\n\nMeanwhile, more rebels are expected to leave the central city of Homs as the evacuation of opposition fighters moves into its second day. Homs is Syria's third largest city and has been known as the capital of anti-Assad revolution since the uprising against his rule erupted in March 2011.\n\nThe Homs governor Talal Barazi told Syrian state TV late on Wednesday that the evacuation process was being conducted in a \"positive atmosphere\". He said Homs would be declared a \"secure\" city once the army moved in later on Thursday.\n\nThe Observatory, which has been documenting Syria's three-year-old conflict through a network of activists on the ground, said about 250 opposition fighters remained in the old districts of Homs, holed up under a crippling government siege for more than two years. The Observatory's head, Rami Abdurrahman, said more than 960 had left the city on Wednesday.\n\nThe rebels agreed to a ceasefire deal on Friday, leading to their evacuation.\n\nIn exchange for the rebels' safe departure from Homs, the opposition fighters have released 70 people who had been held by gunmen in various areas, including in Aleppo and in the costal province of Latakia, Barazi said. Among those released were 17 women and five children, he said.\n\nSyria's uprising began with largely peaceful protests and has evolved into a civil war with sectarian overtones, pitting largely Sunni Muslim rebels against Assad's government, which is dominated by Alawites, a sect of Shia Islam.\n\nIslamic extremists, including foreign fighters and Syrian rebels who have taken up hardline al-Qaida-style ideologies, have played an increasingly prominent role among fighters, dampening the west's support for the rebellion to overthrow Assad.",

The OPCW announced earlier this week that 92.5% of the chemicals \u2013 the core of the Syrian military's stockpile \u2013 had so far been moved to the port of Tartous in the country's north-west.</p><p>From there they will be transferred to Danish and Norwegian ships that will transport them to Spain, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/10/syria-chemical-weapons-disposal-us-ship-cape-ray\" title=\"\">where they will be moved to another ship moored waiting for them at a US Navy base in Cadiz</a>. While the surrender process has run behind schedule, it has taken place without disruption or sabotage.</p><p>Sarin was used in a mass attack on opposition-held areas near Damascus last August, killing between 355 and 1,400 people and prompting the threat of a US strike, which was averted by a deal brokered by Russia for Syria to hand over its stockpiles.</p><p>At the time Syrian officials said all its supplies would be surrendered. However, western officials have suggested that some chemicals used by the military, such as chlorine, may not have been declared.</p><p>Claims that chlorine, or some sort of industrial chemical, had been used in new strikes first surfaced in February after an attack near Damascus.</p><p>Other incidents are alleged to have taken place in Idlib and Homs province. Clothing and blood samples of those affected by gas have been smuggled out of Syria by opposition groups and activists for testing in laboratories in Turkey and France.</p><p>Washington said last week it suspected the Syrian regime had been responsible for the incidents, that are thought to have killed between 20-30 people.</p><p>The OPCW move came as the former head of the UK Defence Ministry's Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear regiment <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/10796175/Syria-chemical-weapons-the-proof-that-Assad-regime-launching-chlorine-attacks-on-children.html\" title=\"\">claimed to have conclusive proof that Syrian forces were responsible for the attacks</a>, which had used chlorine and ammonia.</p><p>\"We have unequivocally proved that the regime has used chlorine and ammonia against its own civilians in the last two to three weeks,\" Hamish de Bretton-Gordon said after receiving three soil samples provided by the Daily Telegraph. He said he could definitively establish chain of custody of the samples, which were taken from areas hit by gas bombs in Idlib province.</p><p>The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) welcomed the new investigation. \"We hope the OPCW mission will establish the facts,\" it said in a statement.</p><p>\"While we believe that some groups operating in Syria are interested in developing a chemical capability, and some have acquired critical components, there is no evidence that any other than the regime possess a chemical weapons capability at present. The regime, by contrast, used chemical weapons in 2013 and has now missed the deadlines set out for the removal of chemicals from Syria.\"</p><p>The question of who used chemical weapons has been the most bitterly contested of a long list of atrocities in Syria's three year war, which has seen more than 150,000 people killed, around nine million people exiled and large parts of the country destroyed.</p><p>Syrian officials have escalated their use of force as the conflict has worn on, sending ballistic missiles into rebel-held areas from January last year and now blitzing opposition parts of Aleppo with barrel bombs that are laying waste to all below and emptying neighbourhoods of remaining residents.</p><p>Human Rights Watch said on Tuesday that satellite imagery had identified at least 85 major impact sites in eastern Aleppo between 22 February and 2 April alone.

                        "text": "The global body supervising the surrender of Syria's chemical weapons is to investigate fresh claims that a less dangerous \u2013 but still lethal \u2013 chlorine gas has been used in recent attacks on opposition areas.\n\nThe Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has announced it will investigate allegations that chlorine has been used at least nine times since February, killing scores of people and wounding hundreds more.\n\nThe move follows intensive lobbying from the US and France who have both indicated in the past fortnight that they believe the Syrian government has been responsible for the attacks.\n\nActivists have chronicled the aftermath of all the incidents and, in some cases, shot video of helicopters dropping large explosive barrels that emitted noxious clouds across areas in which residents showed symptoms of being exposed to gas.\n\nOCPW head Ahmet Uzumcu said in a brief statement that a \"mission would be created to establish facts\" surrounding the latest allegations.\n\nThe new mission comes as the complicated task of withdrawing Syria's 1,300-tonne supply of sarin, mustard gas, and the precursor chemicals used to mix and weaponise them, nears completion. The OPCW announced earlier this week that 92.5% of the chemicals \u2013 the core of the Syrian military's stockpile \u2013 had so far been moved to the port of Tartous in the country's north-west.\n\nFrom there they will be transferred to Danish and Norwegian ships that will transport them to Spain, where they will be moved to another ship moored waiting for them at a US Navy base in Cadiz. While the surrender process has run behind schedule, it has taken place without disruption or sabotage.\n\nSarin was used in a mass attack on opposition-held areas near Damascus last August, killing between 355 and 1,400 people and prompting the threat of a US strike, which was averted by a deal brokered by Russia for Syria to hand over its stockpiles.\n\nAt the time Syrian officials said all its supplies would be surrendered. However, western officials have suggested that some chemicals used by the military, such as chlorine, may not have been declared.\n\nClaims that chlorine, or some sort of industrial chemical, had been used in new strikes first surfaced in February after an attack near Damascus.\n\nOther incidents are alleged to have taken place in Idlib and Homs province. Clothing and blood samples of those affected by gas have been smuggled out of Syria by opposition groups and activists for testing in laboratories in Turkey and France.\n\nWashington said last week it suspected the Syrian regime had been responsible for the incidents, that are thought to have killed between 20-30 people.\n\nThe OPCW move came as the former head of the UK Defence Ministry's Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear regiment claimed to have conclusive proof that Syrian forces were responsible for the attacks, which had used chlorine and ammonia.\n\n\"We have unequivocally proved that the regime has used chlorine and ammonia against its own civilians in the last two to three weeks,\" Hamish de Bretton-Gordon said after receiving three soil samples provided by the Daily Telegraph. He said he could definitively establish chain of custody of the samples, which were taken from areas hit by gas bombs in Idlib province.\n\nThe Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) welcomed the new investigation. \"We hope the OPCW mission will establish the facts,\" it said in a statement.\n\n\"While we believe that some groups operating in Syria are interested in developing a chemical capability, and some have acquired critical components, there is no evidence that any other than the regime possess a chemical weapons capability at present. The regime, by contrast, used chemical weapons in 2013 and has now missed the deadlines set out for the removal of chemicals from Syria.\"\n\nThe question of who used chemical weapons has been the most bitterly contested of a long list of atrocities in Syria's three year war, which has seen more than 150,000 people killed, around nine million people exiled and large parts of the country destroyed.\n\nSyrian officials have escalated their use of force as the conflict has worn on, sending ballistic missiles into rebel-held areas from January last year and now blitzing opposition parts of Aleppo with barrel bombs that are laying waste to all below and emptying neighbourhoods of remaining residents.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said on Tuesday that satellite imagery had identified at least 85 major impact sites in eastern Aleppo between 22 February and 2 April alone. Opposition activists say attacks have intensified since and were also heavy in January.\n\nOpposition forces, among them global jihadists, have also targeted civilian areas. A car bomb in a loyalist area of Homs killed up to 36 people on Tuesday, state media reported. A separate mortar attack in Damascus killed another 14 people, all civilians.",

The UN and other humanitarian agencies have long argued that many hundreds of thousands can only be reached effectively from neighbouring countries such as Turkey and Jordan. But the Syrian government continues to refuse consent for \"cross-border\" operations of this kind despite a clear UN security council demand that it do so. Blatant disregard for the most basic rules of international humanitarian law by the Syrian government and elements of the opposition is causing millions to suffer. But this appalling situation has been compounded by what we deem to be an overly cautious interpretation of international humanitarian law, which has held UN agencies back from delivering humanitarian aid across borders for fear that some member states will find them unlawful.</p><p>As a coalition of leading international lawyers and legal experts, we judge that there is no legal barrier to the UN directly undertaking cross-border humanitarian operations and supporting NGOs to undertake them as well. We argue that cross-border operations by the UN would meet three primary conditions for legality.</p><p>First, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations\" title=\"More from the Guardian on United Nations\">United Nations</a> clearly meets the first condition for legitimate humanitarian action, which requires it respect the principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and non-discrimination in delivering aid.</p><p>Second, in many of these areas various opposition groups, not the Syrian government, are in control of the territory. In such cases, the consent of those parties in effective control of the area through which relief will pass is all that is required by law to deliver aid.</p><p>Third, under international humanitarian law parties can withhold consent only for valid legal reasons, not for arbitrary reasons. For example, parties might temporarily refuse consent for reasons of \"military necessity\" where imminent military operations will take place on the proposed route for aid. They cannot, however, lawfully withhold consent to weaken the resistance of the enemy, cause starvation of civilians, or deny medical assistance. Where consent is withheld for these arbitrary reasons, the relief operation is lawful without consent.</p><p>The UN has been explicit that the Syrian government has arbitrarily denied consent for a wide range of legitimate humanitarian relief operations. According to the top UN official for humanitarian affairs, Valerie Amos, the \"continued withholding of consent to cross-border and cross-line relief operations \u2026 is arbitrary and unjustified.\"</p><p>The stakes for correcting this overly cautious legal interpretation are high \u2013 hundreds of thousands of lives hang in the balance. Humanitarian organisations will surely face enormous risk in carrying out cross-border relief operations and may decline to do so. These are not easy calculations to make.

But Syria has been overshadowed by the crisis in Ukraine, which has made western-Russian co-operation even more difficult. John Kerry, the US secretary of state, cut short a planned meeting with Brahimi in Geneva because of Thursday's Ukraine summit. Homs has been called the \"Stalingrad of the 21st century\" and compared to Srebrenica, the Bosnian town where thousands of Muslims were massacred in 1995.</p><p>The Syrian Opposition Coalition, the main western-backed rebel group, issued an urgent appeal. \"The regime has reduced what was the soul of the revolution to rubble and ruin. The international community must watch to ensure the regime does not massacre the remaining brave people left in the Old City,\" said Monzer Akbik, spokesman for the SOC president, Ahmed al-Jarba.</p><p>Homs was the scene of early protests against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011 and has come to symbolise the destructive nature of Syria's civil war.</p><p>Brahimi oversaw a deal at otherwise unproductive talks in Geneva in January which allowed some 1,400 civilians to leave the old city unharmed. But further negotiations broke down after renewed heavy fighting this week. Dozens of rebels have surrendered to the government.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Syrian army launched an assault against the rebel-held areas and said it had \"achieved key successes\" and \"killed a number of terrorists\".</p><p>In the past few months, Assad government forces have recaptured several rebel-held areas and border towns, closing off supply routes from Lebanon and securing the main road leading north from Damascus towards central Syria, Homs and the Mediterranean. Earlier this week the army recaptured the Christian town of Maaloula in the Qalamun region. Assad has said he believes the war is turning in his favour.</p><p>More than 150,000 people have now been killed in a conflict which began with peaceful protests. About a third of the victims have been civilians, according to the anti-Assad Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Millions have fled the country.</p><p>The Syrian government has been accused of using starvation as a weapon to force rebel-held areas into surrender. The SOC quoted one fighter as saying: \"We don't have any leaves left on the trees.

                        "text": "Syrian government forces stepped up efforts to advance on opposition areas of the central city of Homs on Thursday amid warnings of a potential massacre following months of siege and starvation.\n\nBut reports from the scene described rebels clinging to their positions despite tank shelling, sniper fire and air strikes mounted to help government troops recapture several enclaves in the old city.\n\nLakhdar Brahimi, the UN mediator for Syria, warned that the collapse of negotiations on a truce risked new bloodshed.\n\n\"It is alarming that Homs, whose people have suffered so much throughout these past three years, is again the theatre of death and destruction,\" the Algerian diplomat said in a statement distributed at UN headquarters in New York.\n\n\"We urge all the parties to return to the negotiating table and complete the deal which was on the verge of being signed.\"\n\nRebel groups say that around 1,300 people, mostly fighters, are still trapped inside neighbourhoods besieged by the army and national defence militia forces.\n\nThe UN security council was expected to discuss the deteriorating situation. But Syria has been overshadowed by the crisis in Ukraine, which has made western-Russian co-operation even more difficult. John Kerry, the US secretary of state, cut short a planned meeting with Brahimi in Geneva because of Thursday's Ukraine summit. Homs has been called the \"Stalingrad of the 21st century\" and compared to Srebrenica, the Bosnian town where thousands of Muslims were massacred in 1995.\n\nThe Syrian Opposition Coalition, the main western-backed rebel group, issued an urgent appeal. \"The regime has reduced what was the soul of the revolution to rubble and ruin. The international community must watch to ensure the regime does not massacre the remaining brave people left in the Old City,\" said Monzer Akbik, spokesman for the SOC president, Ahmed al-Jarba.\n\nHoms was the scene of early protests against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011 and has come to symbolise the destructive nature of Syria's civil war.\n\nBrahimi oversaw a deal at otherwise unproductive talks in Geneva in January which allowed some 1,400 civilians to leave the old city unharmed. But further negotiations broke down after renewed heavy fighting this week. Dozens of rebels have surrendered to the government.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Syrian army launched an assault against the rebel-held areas and said it had \"achieved key successes\" and \"killed a number of terrorists\".\n\nIn the past few months, Assad government forces have recaptured several rebel-held areas and border towns, closing off supply routes from Lebanon and securing the main road leading north from Damascus towards central Syria, Homs and the Mediterranean. Earlier this week the army recaptured the Christian town of Maaloula in the Qalamun region. Assad has said he believes the war is turning in his favour.\n\nMore than 150,000 people have now been killed in a conflict which began with peaceful protests. About a third of the victims have been civilians, according to the anti-Assad Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Millions have fled the country.\n\nThe Syrian government has been accused of using starvation as a weapon to force rebel-held areas into surrender. The SOC quoted one fighter as saying: \"We don't have any leaves left on the trees. We've eaten them all.\"\n\nThe siege of the rebel-held neighbourhoods of Homs intensified after tunnels used to smuggle in supplies were destroyed by bombing and bombardments. The last attempt to lift the siege took place a few days ago, but some 25 fighters were killed when government forces targeted a car attempting to force a way out. On Wednesday, there were constant airstrikes on the Old City, but government forces were repulsed by a counter-attack by the rebel Free Syrian Army.",

                        "text": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The United States added new sanctions against Russia on Monday, expanding the list of targets but concentrating on the myriad holdings of four billionaires viewed as part of President Vladimir V. Putin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s financial circle.\n\nAccusing Russia of failing to live up to its agreement to defuse the crisis in Ukraine, the Obama administration took aim at 17 banks, energy companies, investment accounts and other firms controlled by the four men, in what amounted to an attempt to constrain the assets available to Mr. Putin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s close associates and perhaps to the president himself.\n\nAlthough the measures do not explicitly target Mr. Putin, American officials indicated that the choice of targets was intended to send a message to him that any hidden assets he might have could ultimately be affected.\n\nIn addition to the firms, the administration imposed sanctions on seven other prominent Russian figures, including two longtime Putin advisers: Igor I. Sechin, president of the state-owned Rosneft oil company, and Sergei V. Chemezov, the director general of Rostec, the Russian state corporation overseeing high-technology industries. The European Union said it would follow with sanctions on 15 Russians.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe goal here is not to go after Mr. Putin personally,\u00e2\u0080\u009d President Obama told reporters in Manila, where he was wrapping up a weeklong trip to Asia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe goal is to change his calculus\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cto encourage him to actually walk the walk and not just talk the talk when it comes to diplomatically resolving the crisis in Ukraine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe sanctions follow several previous rounds of punitive measures that to date have not noticeably changed Mr. Putin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s calculus, and American officials privately expected no different result in the short term.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect there to be an immediate change in Russian policy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one administration official, briefing reporters under ground rules in which he would not be identified. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat we need to do is to steadily show the Russians that there are going to be much more severe economic pain\u00e2\u0080\u009d and isolation.\n\nAdministration officials, including some in the more hawkish camp, said the new sanctions were a more serious effort than earlier rounds. Some said the \u00e2\u0080\u009csecondary effects\u00e2\u0080\u009d of chilling business with those targeted were becoming more significant, and they expressed optimism that the Europeans were more willing to talk about tougher measures after a team of European military observers was taken captive by pro-Russian forces in eastern Ukraine.\n\nMr. Obama will host Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany at the White House later this week to coordinate whatever the next steps will be against Mr. Putin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s government. Ms. Merkel, whose country has extensive economic, cultural and historical ties to Russia, is seen as the linchpin of any coordinated effort, and Mr. Obama has made it his priority to maintain a united front with the Europeans against Russia.\n\nCritics called the latest sanctions inadequate. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI expected more from these U.S. sanctions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cliff Kupchan, a Russia analyst at the Eurasia Group, a firm that advises businesses. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo have a shot at changing Putin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s calculus, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to get serious on economic measures \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at least hit a large Russian bank. We missed the target today.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnders Aslund, a Russia scholar at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the sanctions were \u00e2\u0080\u009ca whimper\u00e2\u0080\u009d after the tough talk by Mr. Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry.\n\nBut he added that the intent was clearly to send a message to Mr. Putin about any hidden wealth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is going after Putin personally, not the Russian economy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Aslund said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s telling him we know where you have your money. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to sanction you personally.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe actions will freeze any assets in the United States and bar Americans from doing business with the individuals and firms listed. The individuals will also be denied visas to enter the United States. Moreover, the United States will cut off the export or re-export of American-made products to 13 of the companies and deny export licenses for high-technology items that could contribute to Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s military capabilities.\n\nThe 17 firms targeted were all tied to Russian businessmen who were targeted in previous rounds of sanctions. Eleven of the companies are linked to Gennady N. Timchenko, including the Stroytransgaz Group, the pipeline construction arm of Gazprom, and the Volga Group, his private investment holding company. Mr. Timchenko was a co-founder of the Gunvor Group, a commodities trading firm in which the Treasury Department has previously said Mr. Putin has personal investments. Gunvor has adamantly denied that Mr. Putin has any financial ties to the company, and Mr. Timchenko has sold his shares in Gunvor.\n\nThree other firms targeted on Monday were tied to Arkady and Boris Rotenberg: InvestCapitalBank, SMP Bank and Stroygazmontazh. Three others were subsidiaries of Yuri V. Kovalchuk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bank Rossyia: Abros, Zest and Sobinbank. The Treasury Department has referred to Mr. Kovalchuk as the personal cashier for Mr. Putin.\n\nOthers targeted Monday were Dmitri N. Kozak, a deputy prime minister; Vyacheslav V. Volodin, a deputy chief of staff to Mr. Putin; Aleksei Pushkov, chairman of the international affairs committee of the State Duma, the lower house of Parliament; Oleg Belavantsev, appointed by Mr. Putin last month as presidential envoy overseeing the annexed Crimean Peninsula; and Yevgeny Murov, director of Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Federal Protective Service.\n\nAlthough administration officials said over the weekend that they also expected Aleksei B. Miller, the head of the energy giant Gazprom, to be targeted, he was not on Monday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s list, but he may be added later.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cToday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s targeted sanctions, taken in close coordination with the E.U., will increase the impact we have already begun to see on Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own economy as a result of Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions in Ukraine and from U.S. and international sanctions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, said in a statement.\n\nIn imposing sanctions on Mr. Sechin, the administration has targeted a top partner of Exxon Mobil, which has multiple joint ventures with Rosneft. It is not known if Mr. Sechin has any assets in the United States to freeze, but he will no longer be permitted into the country to consult with his Exxon Mobil partners. Exxon Mobil had no comment on Monday.\n\nThat the sanctions covered no large publicly listed Russian companies came as a relief to traders in Moscow. Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benchmark Micex index closed with a modest gain of 1.5 percent. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt looked to be on the light side\u00e2\u0080\u009d of what the markets expected, said one banker in Moscow, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis was more of a reminder that a new phase of sanctions is possible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

But in the case of Mr. Abdel-Wahab, who learned of his sentence from his weeping wife when he returned home from a party on Monday, the accusations are particularly implausible. He is a survivor of multiple heart operations and he is visibly feeble. He insisted that doctors had forbidden him to walk up stairs or inhale smoke, much less battle tear gas and bullets to ransack a police station.

But if the verdicts are not yet final, rights advocates say the two mass death sentences are just the most extreme examples in a pattern of harsh, politicized verdicts supporting the new military-backed government in its sweeping crackdown.

                        "text": "EDWA, Egypt \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Egyptian courts on Monday delivered devastating new blows to both the Islamist and liberal opponents of the new military-backed government.\n\nA court in Minya, a provincial capital, sentenced to death the top spiritual leader of the Muslim Brotherhood along with more than 680 others in connection with the killing of a single police officer during a riot here last summer, while a court in the capital banned the activities of the most effective left-leaning protest group, the April 6 movement, on espionage charges.\n\nThe rulings were the clearest evidence yet of the judiciary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s energetic support for the new government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crackdown on dissent of all kinds in the aftermath of the military ouster last summer of Egypt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only fairly elected president, Mohamed Morsi of the Brotherhood.\n\nThe mass death sentence, announced after a cursory trial of a few sessions lasting just minutes, was the second of its kind from the same court in the space of a month, and it drew condemnation from the White House as well as international rights groups. The reaction threatened to embarrass the new government just as its foreign minister, Nabil Fahmy, was visiting Washington on a mission to persuade the Obama administration to unlock millions of dollars in aid suspended after the military takeover.\n\nYet here in Edwa, a town of a few thousand where at least one member of every extended family appears to have been sentenced to death on Monday morning, anger at the sweeping verdict mixed with wonder at the apparent dysfunction of the courts and police. With only a small portion of the defendants in custody \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and some living openly at home in Edwa \u00e2\u0080\u0094 many residents said they took the verdict as a politicized threat meant to intimidate the Islamist opposition and argued that the executions could never take place without triggering an insurrection.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are living in absurdity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mohamed Abdel-Wahab, 60, the principal of a school who was among those sentenced to death on Monday on charges that he participated in the attack on a local police station that led to the killing of the officer.\n\nBoth of the trials that ended in mass death sentences date to clashes that took place when the security forces used deadly force to break up sit-ins held by Mr. Morsi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supporters to protest his ouster, killing nearly 1,000 people in a day, according to the best estimates by independent rights groups.\n\nThe province of Minya, an Islamist stronghold that was at the center of an insurgency 20 years ago, was a major flash point. Mobs stormed and destroyed several churches and police stations.\n\nTwo of Mr. Abdel-Wahab\u00e2\u0080\u0099s younger relatives were in custody and convicted in the case, and four others were still at large but convicted, he and his family said. They deny that any of their relatives participated in the attack. But in the case of Mr. Abdel-Wahab, who learned of his sentence from his weeping wife when he returned home from a party on Monday, the accusations are particularly implausible. He is a survivor of multiple heart operations and he is visibly feeble. He insisted that doctors had forbidden him to walk up stairs or inhale smoke, much less battle tear gas and bullets to ransack a police station. He pulled up his jalabiya to show surgical scars on both calves.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am the one who broke into the police station and killed the police officer?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked, sitting in his living room surrounded by family.\n\nWhen he learned months ago that he had been charged with participating in the attack, he said, he immediately went to the police to explain that there must be a mistake. He said he told them that he was obviously too unwell to have taken part. And he said that their arrest warrant had listed his age as 45 instead of 60, and his occupation as unemployed. But the police insisted that the charges were correct and, inexplicably, allowed him to leave and continue his work at the school.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEverything is a whim,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no rule of law.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThose like Mr. Abdel-Wahab who were sentenced in absentia \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the vast majority of the defendants \u00e2\u0080\u0094 would be entitled to a retrial if they were brought into custody, and all the verdicts are subject to appeal. In finalizing last month\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mass verdict, the judge in both cases, Saed Youssef, on Monday confirmed the death sentences on 37 of those defendants while commuting 492 to life in prison \u00e2\u0080\u0094 understood here as a term of 25 years. But if the verdicts are not yet final, rights advocates say the two mass death sentences are just the most extreme examples in a pattern of harsh, politicized verdicts supporting the new military-backed government in its sweeping crackdown. Increasingly, said Michele Dunne, an Egypt expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere seems to be no attempt even to construct plausible cases.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe death sentence against the Brotherhood\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spiritual leader, Mohamed Badie, 70, known as the supreme guide, appeared to mark a particular escalation. Trained as a veterinarian, he is revered as a religious authority by hundreds of thousands of Brotherhood members and supporters around the country, and, if carried out, his death sentence would mark the first time the Egyptian government has executed a supreme guide during more than six decades of often-bloody attempts to suppress the Brotherhood. In 1954, the government of President Gamal Abdel Nasser sentenced to death Supreme Guide Hassan el-Houdaibi, but his sentence was later commuted and he was released.\n\nSecurity forces arrested Mr. Badie last summer, and he remains in jail in Cairo facing multiple charges of inciting violence in the aftermath of the military takeover.

Kernes, the mayor of Kharkiv, decided to take matters into his own hands.\n\nHe and his staff created an Instagram account that presented Mr. Kernes the way he wanted to be seen: flexing shirtless in the gym, cuddling some of his 27 dogs and assorted birds and other animals, and bathing in an ice-cold nature preserve as he flashed a trademark peace sign.\n\nHe was running during his cross-fit training regimen in a city park on Monday when a would-be assassin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bullet tore through his chest, missing his heart by millimeters and leaving Mr. Kernes fighting for his life at a hospital. He survived surgery but remained unconscious and in critical condition Monday night. No arrests were made.\n\nIt may never be known who shot Mr. Kernes in the back. Municipal officials and a member of his security detail said Mr. Kernes was struck by a sniper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bullet fired from a considerable distance. An unabashed critic of both sides in eastern Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s simmering conflict, he had plenty of enemies.\n\nBut whoever fired it, the shot that almost killed Mr. Kernes may yet prove fatal to Kharkiv, Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second-largest city, as it seeks to maintain a fragile political balance in the weeks ahead without his guiding hand.\n\nKharkiv, a city with a large Russian-speaking population, lies 20 miles from the border with Russia. Its police forces have so far managed to prevent separatists or antigovernment militias from establishing an armed foothold and declaring the province independent.\n\nMr. Kernes, a colorful and powerful figure who has dominated politics in Kharkiv for several years, has played a large role in keeping things relatively quiet in the city. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is the real boss, the guarantor of stability,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mikhail Dobkin, a presidential candidate and a close friend of Mr. Kernes\u00e2\u0080\u0099s since they met in 1998, said in a telephone interview.\n\nFormerly allied with the deposed president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, Mr. Kernes has charted a middle way, attacking the fledgling, revolutionary government in Kiev but calling for the country to remain united in the face of a possible Russian attack. In other words, among the inert or downright rebellious elected politicians in eastern Ukraine, Mr. Kernes is what passes for an ally to Kiev these days.\n\nMr. Kernes is Jewish, though there are no indications that anti-Semitism played any role in the attack. A friend of Mr. Dobkin who replaced him as acting mayor in Kharkiv in 2007, the mayor is seen as a canny political operator who is not shy about expressing himself.\n\nWhen Mr. Dobkin tried to film a campaign video for his run for governor in 2007, Mr. Kernes was standing behind the camera, bullying Mr. Dobkin with expletive-laced abuse.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have a boring face,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Kernes told Mr. Dobkin at one point. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNobody will give you money.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Dobkin called the shooting of Mr. Kernes a deeply worrying step in the instability gripping the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s east, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow we are seeing the blacker things in life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAlthough considered an ally of Kiev, Mr. Kernes does not enjoy the warmest of relations with the capital. Arsen Avakov, a political rival of Mr. Kernes\u00e2\u0080\u0099s from Kharkiv and now the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interim interior minister, has backed the prosecution of Mr. Kernes on suspicion of murder and kidnapping, charges that the mayor has called politically motivated.\n\nIn an interview in March, Mr. Kernes said he believed that the new government in Kiev was fueling disillusionment in the east and was apathetic about the interests of local people.\n\nYet he also said that he believed the political crisis in Ukraine would subside after the referendum for the peninsula of Crimea to secede from Ukraine. That was March 16, and things have only grown worse in the east, where pro-Russian separatists have seized public buildings in at least 10 cities.\n\nIn the interview, Mr. Kernes spoke in a small dining room in the National Hotel, where he has lived for the past seven years, and which his bodyguards keep under round-the-clock protection.\n\nMr. Kernes seemed exhausted discussing the dire political situation in Kharkiv, but brightened when asked about the photographs he is best known for on social networks.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf all the mayors, my Instagram account is the best,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, and then asked a bodyguard to lead out a purebred dog that also lived in the hotel.\n\nSince the interview, as a wave of political turmoil has gripped eastern Ukraine, cities close to Kharkiv have slipped from Kiev\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery time that we think we have hit bottom, something comes knocking from down below,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tatyana Gruzinskaya, a personal aide to Mr. Kernes, said in the March interview.\n\nOn Monday, Ms. Gruzinskaya stood outside the hospital where Mr. Kernes underwent a two-hour operation to repair damage to his lungs and remained under anesthesia in the evening.\n\nDeath threats had been piling up, she said, but he had not changed his routine of running or biking the city streets in the mornings.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe likes to run in the city, to show that he is out there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ms. Gruzinskaya said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would never have called him a very careful person,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has been like this since I met him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

                        "text": "SLOVYANSK, Ukraine \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Antigovernment militants in eastern Ukraine on Saturday rebuffed international calls for the release of a group of European military observers, but suggested that they would consider a prisoner exchange.\n\nThe military observers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a group of officers reportedly from Germany, Poland, Sweden, the Czech Republic and Denmark \u00e2\u0080\u0094 were detained on Friday at a rebel checkpoint at the edge of this city while traveling with a Ukrainian military delegation, which was also held.\n\nThe observers, known as a military verification team, had been working under the auspices of a document from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that allows member nations \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Ukraine, in this case \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to invite other member nations to send observers to examine security conditions.\n\nThe militants have accused the observers of espionage.\n\nEarly Sunday morning, a spokesman for the O.S.C.E. in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, said members of its special monitoring mission to Ukraine, a set of monitors distinct from the detained military observers, would travel to Slovyansk from Donetsk to meet with the rebel authorities. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking forward to access Slovyansk as soon as possible to play a role in the resolution,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the spokesman, Michael B. Bociurkiw.\n\nThe detention of the observers and the allegations led to a day of swift-moving diplomatic developments. Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, spoke by telephone with his counterparts in the United States and Germany and with the president of Switzerland, Didier Burkhalter, who is also the chairman of the O.S.C.E.\n\nIn his phone call with Mr. Lavrov, Secretary of State John Kerry urged Russia to use its influence with the pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine to ensure that the detained observers and their Ukrainian guides be released \u00e2\u0080\u009cwithout preconditions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a senior State Department official said. Mr. Kerry is opposed to any prisoner exchange, the official said.\n\nFrank-Walter Steinmeier, Germany\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foreign minister, said he welcomed Mr. Lavrov\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pledge to help free the observers.\n\nAndrei Kelin, Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s representative to the security and cooperation group, said Russia would take \u00e2\u0080\u009call possible steps\u00e2\u0080\u009d to help secure the observers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 release. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe think that these people need to be freed as soon as possible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, according to Itar-Tass.\n\nThe situation has been complicated by rival interpretations of the observers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 role, in part because their organization has taken pains to draw a public distinction between its permanent mission in Ukraine and the detained military observer team, and has said all of its staff members are accounted for.\n\nRebels have seized upon the organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statements to characterize the observers as NATO spies who used poor judgment and entered areas outside their host government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s control without invitation or permission.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe officers we currently have do not have any relation to the O.S.C.E.,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vyachislav Ponomaryov, the self-appointed mayor of Slovyansk, said in an interview. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe O.S.C.E. disowned them. They were here to carry out their military mission.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Ponomaryov brushed off questions about his plans for them, hinting only that he might consider exchanging them for prisoners held by Ukraine, perhaps including his deputy, who he said had disappeared while returning from Moscow and might be in Ukrainian government custody. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we have the chance to swap them, we will do it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf not, let them live with us. Maybe they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start families in time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn a public appearance later, Mr. Ponomaryov said he had no direct contact with Russia about the detainees. Asked whether the statement of Mr. Kelin, the Russian diplomat, might influence his thinking, he answered nonchalantly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do not know this person,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nMr. Ponomaryov claims to control at least 40 additional prisoners, whom he calls Ukrainian \u00e2\u0080\u009csaboteurs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA Ukrainian journalist working for Telekanal Zik, a Ukrainian Internet TV station, was also detained Friday, after recording a video report near the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main square, his colleagues said. The journalist, Yuri Lelyavsky, from Lviv in western Ukraine, was heard speaking Ukrainian on camera before being approached by men in camouflage and head coverings, they said.\n\nMr. Ponomaryov swept aside questions about him as well, saying only that saboteurs sometimes use journalistic cover.\n\nOn Friday, armed pro-Ukrainian forces in masks reportedly detained and deported two journalists from LifeNews, a Kremlin-aligned Russian television station.

Civilian vehicles were allowed to pass after a brief search and document check.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur objective is simply to make sure no armed people or weapons pass through,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sergey, a commander of the Ukrainian Interior Ministry troops at the checkpoint who declined to give his last name.\n\nLater in the day, in a crowded auditorium in Slovyansk, anti-Kiev residents appointed a new people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s council loyal to Mr. Ponomaryov. The residents appeared impatient as speakers described how this new government would be organized.\n\nResidents also gathered for the funeral for Aleksandr V. Lubenets, 21, who they said died after being shot near a checkpoint that had been attacked by Ukrainian forces. The attack, one man said, only drove eastern Ukrainian provinces closer to Russia.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDonbass, Kharkov, Russia \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one teary-eyed man, Nikolai Nikushin, referring to two regions of eastern Ukraine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all together.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

Protesters there were among the first to take up arms against the state, and Homs neighborhoods were the first to suffer indiscriminate bombardment by government forces.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"222\" data-total-count=\"532\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Homs long stood as a bellwether for a nation slowly, brutally, unraveling. A diverse community increasingly split along sectarian lines as populations fled, neighborhoods were destroyed and rebels held out in the Old City.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"431\" data-total-count=\"963\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">On Wednesday, the last insurgent-held neighborhoods of the Old City appeared to be falling to the government as the last fighters and their families began to evacuate under a deal freighted with symbolism for both sides. The government seeks to prove that through brute force and local talks, it can retake a major urban area. For its opponents, handing over enclaves that withstood a nearly two-year blockade is an emotional blow.</p>    <aside class=\"marginalia related-coverage-marginalia\" data-marginalia-type=\"sprinkled\" role=\"complementary\">\n\t\t<a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-6\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n\t\t\n            <header>\n        <h2 class=\"module-heading\">\n                            Related Coverage\n                    </h2>\n    </header>\n\n        \n\n    </aside>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"385\" data-total-count=\"1348\" itemprop=\"articleBody\" id=\"story-continues-6\">But the deal was less than a full victory for the government, or a complete defeat for the rebels.

                        "text": "BEIRUT, Lebanon \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Syria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third-largest city, Homs, was one of the first to hold large demonstrations against President Bashar al-Assad. Protesters there were among the first to take up arms against the state, and Homs neighborhoods were the first to suffer indiscriminate bombardment by government forces.\n\nHoms long stood as a bellwether for a nation slowly, brutally, unraveling. A diverse community increasingly split along sectarian lines as populations fled, neighborhoods were destroyed and rebels held out in the Old City.\n\nOn Wednesday, the last insurgent-held neighborhoods of the Old City appeared to be falling to the government as the last fighters and their families began to evacuate under a deal freighted with symbolism for both sides. The government seeks to prove that through brute force and local talks, it can retake a major urban area. For its opponents, handing over enclaves that withstood a nearly two-year blockade is an emotional blow.\n\nBut the deal was less than a full victory for the government, or a complete defeat for the rebels. The fighters were allowed to flee with light weapons to a safe haven where they vowed to continue the battle. The deal did little to head off the fragmentation of the country as both sides continue to refuse a broad negotiated settlement to a war that has taken more than 150,000 lives.\n\nEven as insurgents fled, their representatives were in Washington pleading for weapons to shoot down government aircraft. And the Syrian government was preparing to reaffirm Mr. Assad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hold on power by staging an election.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are not asking our friends to send their sons to our country, and we are also not asking for a direct intervention, even one from the air,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ahmad Assi al-Jarba, who leads the Syrian opposition coalition, said in an interview in Washington on Tuesday night.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are asking for antiaircraft weapons in order to neutralize these planes, which are throwing the barrel bombs on us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, referring to bombs, used by the Syrian Air Force, made from barrels filled with shrapnel and explosives. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd we have plans and guarantees that these weapons will not fall into the wrong hands.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Homs deal, worked out between security officials and rebel representatives in the presence of Iran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ambassador to Syria, also calls for insurgents in Aleppo Province, to the north, to lift their longstanding blockade of two villages, activists briefed by rebel negotiators said.\n\nIf the pact holds, it could be the most complex and far-reaching yet struck between combatants in the conflict. International peace talks have failed. Local cease-fires percolating around the country are shaky and disputed. The government calls them reconciliation but opponents see them as surrender to tactics of starvation and indiscriminate bombing.\n\nThe Homs deal offers no comprehensive way forward for a country that has suffered more than three years of fighting, with millions forced from their homes. It does nothing to address government opponents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 underlying political grievances, deepened by the crackdown, or the mass displacement of residents, or the shell shock of a city turned upside down.\n\nThe once graceful historic district has been bombarded into grim lacework by the government. Its streets have been mined, and in some places burned, by fleeing fighters. Its last residents are leaving, except for six Christian families, who survived the siege alongside mainly Sunni fighters and civilians, and plan to remain, along with a single Sunni family, said an activist there, Beybars al-Tilawi.\n\nHe blamed international powers and insurgent commanders for their inaction, and said he was now dispossessed like Palestinians, but at the hands of \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe son of my own country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSome fighters wept and kissed the ground before boarding buses escorted by the United Nations, their belongings crammed into the single bag each was allowed, along with one rifle. About 600 of an estimated 1,900 people had left by day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s end, activists said.

That added muscle to the government position, a rebel negotiator using the name Abu al-Harith said, adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe upper hand and the louder voice is the Iranians\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, there were signs that the agreement extended beyond Homs.

Mr. Putin wants to shape Ukraine\u2019s future, but an invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Army would be wildly expensive, bloody and unpredictable. Even a nominally successful invasion could breed an insurgency in the east by pro-Ukrainian militants, while the partition of the country would stick Russia with a failed state in southeast Ukraine that would take tens of billions to restructure. It would also create an implacably anti-Russian and pro-European state in western Ukraine that would most likely join NATO as fast as it could.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"222\" data-total-count=\"5059\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">And an invasion would almost certainly galvanize the European Union into joining the United States in imposing much tougher sanctions that might target entire sections of the Russian economy, like banking, energy or steel.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"300\" data-total-count=\"5359\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The Russian aim in Ukraine has always been clear, analysts said. Mr. Putin wanted to annex Crimea with minimal cost, which he appears to have done. Generally, Washington and the European capitals have been so focused on the possible dismemberment of Ukraine that Crimea was shunted to a back burner.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"488\" data-total-count=\"5847\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Mr. Putin wants to maintain the ability, they say, to manipulate events in Ukraine to keep the country out of a full embrace by the European Union and, worse, NATO. Toward that end, Russia has been pushing for regional autonomy, a slippery concept that leaves plenty of room for maneuvering at a later date. If he can get European mediators to push through an autonomy plan that keeps southeast Ukraine in Moscow\u2019s orbit \u2014 without risking his army or sanctions \u2014 so much the better.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"321\" data-total-count=\"6168\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u201cHe really promised nothing,\u201d noted Kirill Rogov, an economic analyst and political commentator in Moscow. \u201cHe demonstrated that he controls the level of tension in Ukraine. He can return the situation to the high levels of violence at any moment. He did not refuse the referendum, but only proposed delaying it.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"111\" data-total-count=\"6279\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Above all, perhaps, Mr. Putin is known to loathe chaos, and southeast Ukraine was staggering in that direction.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"337\" data-total-count=\"6616\" itemprop=\"articleBody\" id=\"story-continues-2\">Analysts suggested that if eastern Ukraine were to vote in the referendum Sunday to join Russia, or for independence, or if they demanded Russian protection in some orchestrated way, Mr. Putin would be forced to react, given his past statements about Russia\u2019s responsibility to ensure the safety of ethnic Russians beyond its borders.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"237\" data-total-count=\"6853\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u201cThe decision was taken not to increase Russian involvement in Ukraine, and not to increase the chances of major violence there,\u201d said Konstantin von Eggert, an independent political analyst and a commentator for Kommersant FM radio.</p><aside class=\"marginalia comments-marginalia  comment-prompt-marginalia\" data-marginalia-type=\"sprinkled\" data-skip-to-para-id=\"story-continues-8\">\n</aside><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"321\" data-total-count=\"7174\" itemprop=\"articleBody\" id=\"story-continues-8\">Most analysts believe that Mr. Putin wanted to avoid war, and say that a minor armed incursion into Ukraine would not have been enough to resolve the crisis. Instead, it could easily have developed into a long, bloody and expensive slog, bruising the reputation he gained from annexing Crimea with virtually no bloodshed.</p><figure class=\"promo media video embedded has-adjacency layout-large-horizontal\" data-videoid=\"100000002858088\" data-media-action=\"modal\" data-autoplay=\"false\" aria-label=\"media\" role=\"group\">\n    <a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-4\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n    <span class=\"visually-hidden\">Video</span>\n    <div class=\"image\">\n        <img src=\"http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/01/multimedia/sanctionsexplained/sanctionsexplained-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg\"/>\n        \n    </div>\n    <figcaption class=\"caption\">\n        <h4 class=\"headline\">U.S. Sanctions Strategy, Explained</h4>\n        <p class=\"summary\">Some background on the impact of sanctions on Russia and what could happen if the Western leaders decide to go further.</p>\n        <div class=\"kicker-credit\">\n            <p class=\"credit video-credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">\n                                        <span class=\"video-journalist-credit\"><span class=\"visually-hidden\">Credit</span> By Natalia V.

It would also create an implacably anti-Russian and pro-European state in western Ukraine that would most likely join NATO as fast as it could.\n\nAnd an invasion would almost certainly galvanize the European Union into joining the United States in imposing much tougher sanctions that might target entire sections of the Russian economy, like banking, energy or steel.\n\nThe Russian aim in Ukraine has always been clear, analysts said. Mr. Putin wanted to annex Crimea with minimal cost, which he appears to have done. Generally, Washington and the European capitals have been so focused on the possible dismemberment of Ukraine that Crimea was shunted to a back burner.\n\nMr. Putin wants to maintain the ability, they say, to manipulate events in Ukraine to keep the country out of a full embrace by the European Union and, worse, NATO. Toward that end, Russia has been pushing for regional autonomy, a slippery concept that leaves plenty of room for maneuvering at a later date. If he can get European mediators to push through an autonomy plan that keeps southeast Ukraine in Moscow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orbit \u00e2\u0080\u0094 without risking his army or sanctions \u00e2\u0080\u0094 so much the better.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe really promised nothing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d noted Kirill Rogov, an economic analyst and political commentator in Moscow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe demonstrated that he controls the level of tension in Ukraine. He can return the situation to the high levels of violence at any moment. He did not refuse the referendum, but only proposed delaying it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAbove all, perhaps, Mr. Putin is known to loathe chaos, and southeast Ukraine was staggering in that direction.\n\nAnalysts suggested that if eastern Ukraine were to vote in the referendum Sunday to join Russia, or for independence, or if they demanded Russian protection in some orchestrated way, Mr. Putin would be forced to react, given his past statements about Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s responsibility to ensure the safety of ethnic Russians beyond its borders.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe decision was taken not to increase Russian involvement in Ukraine, and not to increase the chances of major violence there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Konstantin von Eggert, an independent political analyst and a commentator for Kommersant FM radio.\n\nMost analysts believe that Mr. Putin wanted to avoid war, and say that a minor armed incursion into Ukraine would not have been enough to resolve the crisis. Instead, it could easily have developed into a long, bloody and expensive slog, bruising the reputation he gained from annexing Crimea with virtually no bloodshed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis one would not have been bloodless,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. von Eggert said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis would have been a real war, not by stealth, not by new methods, but a real old-fashioned war, and this is something that Mr. Putin does not want.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe intense public support generated in recent months, all the glow about renewed Russian strength, would have evaporated.\n\nMr. Putin repeated Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longstanding demands. He said the authorities in Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, should immediately halt all military actions in southeast Ukraine. He demanded the release of all prisoners linked to the uprising. He also expressed sympathy for the goals and actions of the rebels in the southeast, where armed men have paralyzed most of the major cities by seizing government buildings and barricading themselves inside, with just enough weapons to fend off government attempts to recapture them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can understand the people in southeast Ukraine, who say that if others can do what they like in Kiev, carry out a coup d\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e9tat, take up arms and seize government buildings, police stations and military garrisons, then why shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t they be allowed to defend their interests and lawful rights?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Putin told the news conference, according to the official Kremlin transcript of his remarks. The Kremlin has for months referred to the interim government as a \u00e2\u0080\u009cjunta,\u00e2\u0080\u009d called it illegitimate and warned of its infiltration by neo-fascists.\n\nThe reaction in Kiev and among separatists in southeast Ukraine was a combination of suspicion and mistrust.\n\nIn Kiev, Andriy Parubiy, the head of Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national security council, said that Mr. Putin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarks were \u00e2\u0080\u009cclear evidence\u00e2\u0080\u009d of what Moscow had been denying all along, that the separatist movement was directed from Russia.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe understand that the center of the Ukrainian crisis is not in Slovyansk, not in Donetsk, not in Luhansk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Parubiy said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe center of the Ukrainian crisis is coordinated in the Kremlin.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe added that the call to delay the referendum in Donetsk was not surprising given that it was illegal and impossible to carry out because the separatists control only a few public buildings in the center of a dozen or so cities.\n\nOn Wednesday, the militants seemed perplexed by the Kremlin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement. Both Moscow and the militants have repeatedly said that their actions are not coordinated, despite the shadowy presence of well-trained, well-armed men Ukraine accuses of being part of the Russian military or special agents.\n\nIn Slovyansk, the ground zero of some of the toughest, most militarily experienced opposition to Kiev, the separatist mayor, Vyachislav Ponomaryov, first claimed that he had not heard Mr. Putin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement and then confessed confusion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know exactly who he is appealing to with this request,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Ponomaryov said.\n\nHe added that the militants were still ready to hold the referendum, that the ballots were prepared and polling stations were being set up. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf a collective decision is made not to hold the referendum, then we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOtherwise, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ready.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

                        "text": "SLOVYANSK, Ukraine \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Pro-Russian militants in eastern Ukraine vowed on Thursday to press ahead with a referendum seeking autonomy, a risky move that seemed to defy their political patron, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, whose motives in urging a delay in the vote came under furious attack by officials in Kiev.\n\nA day after Mr. Putin scrambled the political landscape by suggesting the vote be put off, militant leaders in Donetsk, Luhansk and Slovyansk said they would go ahead on Sunday as scheduled. Far from mollified by Mr. Putin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new stance, Ukrainian officials expressed deep suspicions, accusing him of trying to replay events preceding Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annexation of Crimea.\n\nAlthough the ability of separatists to stage a legitimate ballot is highly in doubt, the mere possibility that Russia would use the vote as a pretext for another territorial grab had officials in Kiev calling the referendum illegal and insisting that action to suppress the armed separatists would continue in the days ahead.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Ukrainian state has never planned any referendum,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the head of Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s National Security Council, Andriy Parubiy, said at a news conference in Kiev. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe cannot cancel or postpone something that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist. This is political fraud.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHowever the process plays out on Sunday, the prospect of resolving the Ukrainian crisis will hinge more on the reactions in Moscow, Kiev and the West than on the results \u00e2\u0080\u0094 real or forged.\n\nUkrainian officials said Mr. Putin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarks were intended to continue destabilizing the country with an eye toward disrupting the far more consequential presidential elections scheduled for May 25. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAny calls for their postponement are not an expression of good will, but simply farce,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the foreign ministry said in a statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis scenario has already been played by Russia in Crimea.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut some analysts said Mr. Putin was hedging against the inability of insurgents to pull off a successful ballot measure.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey control dozens of buildings, but not the entire territory, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the administrative capacity to organize a vote,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michael McFaul, who until earlier this year served as the United States ambassador in Russia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMoreover, polls show that a free and fair election there would not produce support for splitting with Ukraine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn Moscow on Thursday, Mr. Putin briefly echoed the remarks he made a day earlier about seeking a diplomatic solution to the Ukrainian crisis through mediation by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\n\nIn another gesture of reconciliation, Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s acting president, Oleksander Turchynov, and prime minister, Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, in a statement offered amnesty to any insurgents who did not have \u00e2\u0080\u009cblood on their hands.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCaught off guard by Mr. Putin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surprise remarks on Wednesday, separatist leaders in southeastern Ukraine regained their balance Thursday, insisting the referendum would go ahead as planned. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think he has reasons to propose rescheduling the referendum,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the self-appointed mayor of Slovyansk, Vyachislav Ponomaryov, told reporters Thursday afternoon. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know these reasons. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ready to hold it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Ponomaryov displayed what he said was a sample ballot that contained a single question, printed in both Russian and Ukrainian: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you support the declaration of independence of the Donetsk People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Republic?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe predicted that an \u00e2\u0080\u009coverwhelming majority\u00e2\u0080\u009d would vote in favor of independence, a step that he indicated would mean closer relations with Russia and, perhaps, eventual union with the Russian Federation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor now, we should just specify for ourselves that we should definitively secede from Kiev,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Ponomaryov said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll decide for ourselves which path to take further.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis optimism notwithstanding, even the simplest mechanics of the vote remained unclear. Less than 72 hours before voting would begin, the rebel authorities in Slovyansk had yet to disclose even a list of polling places. On Tuesday, Mr. Ponomaryov did not know if there would be 56 or 156 polling places in the city.\n\nAs a result, the decision to proceed with the vote was fraught with risks for the rebels, who have managed to disrupt eastern Ukraine but control only a small amount of territory.\n\nIf the voting reaches only a tiny portion of Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eastern population, as many here expect, it will highlight their lack of support among the population at large.\n\nWhile a chaotic voting process might discredit insurgent leaders, Ukrainian officials were not willing to stand by and hope for a mess, particularly given the level of misinformation that has been broadcast repeatedly on Russian state-controlled news media throughout the crisis. Just a polling station or two with a line of voters could provide the backdrop needed to make the vote appear legitimate on television to millions of viewers.\n\nIllustrating officials\u00e2\u0080\u0099 concerns about fraud, the Ukrainian security service posted a recording on its website, on Wednesday, that it said proved Russian involvement in coordinating both the unrest in eastern Ukraine and the referendum on independence, including plans to falsify results.\n\nThe recording was of a phone call that the security service said took place between a pro-Russian political operative named Aleksandr Barkashov, who was identified as being in Moscow, and Dmytro Boitsov, a leader of rebels in Donetsk.\n\nThe authenticity of the recording could not be independently verified.\n\nIn the conversation, riddled with expletives, Mr. Boitsov suggests canceling the referendum and Mr. Barkashov insists that it must go forward, but says that it is ridiculous to consider holding a real vote.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you going to walk around and collect papers?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asks incredulously, his words punctuated by curses. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you insane?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Barkashov adds: \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s say that 89 percent voted for the Donetsk Republic and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGiven the risks of manipulation, the acting Ukrainian president, Mr. Turchynov, and the prime minister, Mr. Yatsenyuk, continued to denounce the referendum and Mr. Putin, even as they called for a national round table to discuss the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political future. By their reckoning, it seemed as if the Russian president had stage-managed yet another deft maneuver in his geopolitical feud with the West, presenting himself as a conciliator while also reasserting, as he has for weeks, that the rebels in eastern Ukraine are not under Kremlin control.\n\nUkrainian officials said they did not believe Mr. Putin would pull back troops along the border, and they suggested that he was simply buying time, allowing his agents on the ground to continue stirring unrest while giving Russia flexibility to intervene further and potentially take steps to cast doubt on the Ukrainian presidential election this month.\n\nThe presidential race is viewed in Kiev, and particularly by Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Western allies, as critical to installing a government that even Russia must accept as valid, and allowing the country to open a new chapter that will almost certainly involve closer ties with Europe.\n\nWhile officials said they suspected the rebels\u00e2\u0080\u0099 referendum was intended to mimic the series of events that led to Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annexation of Crimea, the road has been far rockier for separatists in the east.\n\nIn Crimea, Moscow made clear that it supported the idea of a public referendum. Mr. Putin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarks covering southeastern Ukraine suggested a far murkier situation, in which the Kremlin seemed reluctant to take responsibility for the region, with its shabby economy and where surveys have indicated a majority of the population does not support joining Russia.\n\nIn another development, officials from the Pentagon and NATO questioned Mr. Putin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assertion on Wednesday that Russia had pulled back its troops from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAnders Fogh Rasmussen, the secretary general of NATO, wrote on Twitter that while the alliance had taken note of Mr. Putin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statement, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo far we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seen any \u00e2\u0080\u0094 any \u00e2\u0080\u0094 indication of troops pulling back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

Several hundred fighters remained in the Old City after nearly 1,000 left on Wednesday for insurgent-held areas in northern Homs Province. Scores of prisoners and hostages held by rebels in Aleppo and Latakia Provinces have been released.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"499\" data-total-count=\"2089\" itemprop=\"articleBody\" id=\"story-continues-2\">The problems on Thursday highlighted the challenges of carrying out a deal that requires cooperation from far-flung, disconnected insurgent groups. The accord, which provides for rebels to leave the blockaded Old City with their weapons and hand over the symbolic territory to the government, has been seen as a turning point for both sides after a nearly two-year standoff that has reduced fighters and civilians in the center of Homs, once called the \u201ccity of the revolution,\u201d to eating grass.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"404\" data-total-count=\"2493\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Despite the hitches, several more busloads of rebels arrived in northern Homs and could be seen, in videos posted online, smiling and hugging in apparent relief. The governor, Talal Barazi, toured a damaged square just outside the Old City with television cameras, vowing against a backdrop of blackened buildings, \u201cWhen the armed men leave the Old City of Homs, we will rebuild the city in no time.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"470\" data-total-count=\"2963\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Mr. Barazi did not address the presence of increasingly pro-government militias, some of whose members have expressed anger at anything short of total defeat for the insurgents. He said that a similar evacuation deal was in the works for the last rebel-held neighborhood in Homs, Hay al-Waer, an area of high-rises on the city\u2019s outskirts. Some 200,000 people in the neighborhood, half of them displaced from elsewhere, remain under a government blockade and shelling.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"250\" data-total-count=\"3213\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Saying a process of reconciliation was underway, Mr. Barazi and state television correspondents were careful to describe those departing as gunmen or fighters, not terrorists, as official news media have typically called the entire armed opposition.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"279\" data-total-count=\"3492\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">With Mr. Barazi on state television was Yacoub El Hillo, the senior United Nations official in Syria, who praised the deal as a way of calming the conflict. United Nations vehicles accompanied the departing insurgents and the aid convoy, along with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"186\" data-total-count=\"3678\" itemprop=\"articleBody\" id=\"story-continues-3\">Ahmad al-Ali, a member of a local government committee in Homs, told state television: \u201cWe won.

                        "text": "BEIRUT, Lebanon \u00e2\u0080\u0094 A deal to evacuate insurgents from the Old City of Homs in central Syria hit a snag on Thursday when rebels in Aleppo Province refused to allow all of a humanitarian convoy to enter two villages they had blockaded, as called for under a pact between the government and the rebels, opposition activists and a pro-government television channel reported.\n\nThe problems came as insurgents in the northern city of Aleppo set off an enormous explosion that leveled the historic Carlton Hotel, facing the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ancient citadel, where government troops had been billeted. Clouds of dust and debris towered above the citadel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ramparts, underscoring the insurgents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 vow to continue the fight and their ability to carry out damaging attacks despite retreating from Homs.\n\nThe Islamic Front, the insurgent coalition that claimed responsibility for the blast, also controls territory where the aid convoys were blocked from entering the villages of Nubol and Zahra. Its members are among those who have objected to the deal on the grounds that rebels should make no compromise with the government.\n\nThe government was preventing the last busload of fighters from leaving Homs\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Old City until the aid was allowed to reach the villages, the Lebanese television channel Al Mayadeen reported, leaving the completion of the deal in limbo. Several hundred fighters remained in the Old City after nearly 1,000 left on Wednesday for insurgent-held areas in northern Homs Province. Scores of prisoners and hostages held by rebels in Aleppo and Latakia Provinces have been released.\n\nThe problems on Thursday highlighted the challenges of carrying out a deal that requires cooperation from far-flung, disconnected insurgent groups. The accord, which provides for rebels to leave the blockaded Old City with their weapons and hand over the symbolic territory to the government, has been seen as a turning point for both sides after a nearly two-year standoff that has reduced fighters and civilians in the center of Homs, once called the \u00e2\u0080\u009ccity of the revolution,\u00e2\u0080\u009d to eating grass.\n\nDespite the hitches, several more busloads of rebels arrived in northern Homs and could be seen, in videos posted online, smiling and hugging in apparent relief. The governor, Talal Barazi, toured a damaged square just outside the Old City with television cameras, vowing against a backdrop of blackened buildings, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen the armed men leave the Old City of Homs, we will rebuild the city in no time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Barazi did not address the presence of increasingly pro-government militias, some of whose members have expressed anger at anything short of total defeat for the insurgents. He said that a similar evacuation deal was in the works for the last rebel-held neighborhood in Homs, Hay al-Waer, an area of high-rises on the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outskirts. Some 200,000 people in the neighborhood, half of them displaced from elsewhere, remain under a government blockade and shelling.\n\nSaying a process of reconciliation was underway, Mr. Barazi and state television correspondents were careful to describe those departing as gunmen or fighters, not terrorists, as official news media have typically called the entire armed opposition.\n\nWith Mr. Barazi on state television was Yacoub El Hillo, the senior United Nations official in Syria, who praised the deal as a way of calming the conflict. United Nations vehicles accompanied the departing insurgents and the aid convoy, along with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent.\n\nAhmad al-Ali, a member of a local government committee in Homs, told state television: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe won. We are standing here in the heart of Homs, and all the unwanted are leaving the town.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSome opponents of the government have described the deal as a way of pushing people opposed to President Bashar al-Assad, disproportionately Sunni Muslims, out of Homs, and have expressed concern that the demographic makeup of the diverse city, Syria\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third largest, is being altered.\n\nIt was unclear why the convoy to the Aleppo villages had failed. Some reports said that insurgents had wanted to allow in only a few trucks, but that the government had refused to let the convoy go farther unless all 12 trucks were allowed.\n\nJamal Awad, a local official from Zahra who fled to a Damascus suburb, said in a telephone interview that the first truck had been stopped by insurgents, emptied and forced to go back. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur men in the village were watching what was happening\u00e2\u0080\u009d through binoculars, he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey saw the armed group quarreling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut in an indication that other aspects of the deal were moving forward, Mr. Awad said insurgents had released 13 of the 63 civilians abducted from a bus months ago.\n\nState television said that insurgents had freed at least 40 women and children in Latakia Province after killing numerous civilians there last year in villages populated by the Alawite minority, to which Mr. Assad belongs. The massacre was documented by Human Rights Watch.\n\nIn Aleppo, the Islamic Front declared that the attack on the hotel, by fighters who tunneled underneath it, had killed 50 soldiers and was a response to the indiscriminate bombing that has killed hundreds of civilians in the province in recent months.

For three years now, political turmoil has scared many travelers away from Egypt, leaving millions of people whose livelihoods depend on visitors desperate for any sign of an end to the most sustained tourism crisis anyone here can recall.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"454\" data-total-count=\"904\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">At <a title=\"Company web site\" href=\"http://www.cosmos.com.eg/index.html\">Cosmos</a>, a 37-year-old tour company in Cairo that used to serve up to 30,000 customers a year, Khaled M. Ismail, the company\u2019s director of operations, said he had not booked a single visitor since May 2013. The company\u2019s once-hectic headquarters are deserted most of the time: Employees come in only once a week, to pay the bills. \u201cWe\u2019re not expecting any business until 2015,\u201d Mr. Ismail said, sitting alone in his office one recent weekday.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"387\" data-total-count=\"1291\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The loss of tourism has taken a disastrous toll on the economy, starving the country of income and badly needed foreign currency. Now many people in Egypt talk not just about short-term pain but long-term damage, as workers forsake years of training and experience to hunt for new jobs outside the industry, and students abandon what had been the country\u2019s most promising career track.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"235\" data-total-count=\"1526\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Others, though, are holding out, nervously watching their nest eggs dwindle as they wait for things to improve. \u201cWhat was saved has been spent,\u201d said Raafat Ferghani Khattab, a guide in Cairo who called tourism the family business.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"408\" data-total-count=\"1934\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Mr. Khattab, whose grandfather showed a Swedish king the sights in the early 20th century, said tourism was \u201cthe nerve system of the middle class.\u201d It is not just families like his that are suffering, he said; the ripples from the crisis have affected people like the farmers who supply organic fruit to hotels, and even pharmacists with shops in resort areas. \u201cThey are back to square one,\u201d he said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"535\" data-total-count=\"2469\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">There is little relief in sight. Egypt\u2019s political struggles turned increasingly violent after the ouster of the elected Islamist president, Mohamed Morsi, last July. Hundreds of protesters have been killed by the security services, and militants have carried out deadly attacks on soldiers, police officers and civilians. Holiday makers were directly caught up in violence for the first time in about three years in February, when militants <a title=\"Times article\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/17/world/middleeast/bus-bombing-kills-tourists-in-sinai-egypt.html\">bombed a bus</a> filled with South Korean visitors in a Sinai resort town, killing four people.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"259\" data-total-count=\"2728\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Tourism officials who tried last year to persuade the world that fears about Egypt were overblown are turning now to increasingly imaginative pitches, like promoting a spiritual retreat in a Cairo park, meant to sell a country that until recently sold itself.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"543\" data-total-count=\"3271\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Having given up on trying to attract business from the United States or many European countries, officials have focused instead on Arab tourists, hoping that regional good will and nostalgia for Egypt will trump concerns about safety. \u201cThey are comfortable here,\u201d Rasha al-Azaizy, a tourism ministry spokeswoman, said of Arab visitors, who traditionally made up a fifth of Egypt\u2019s tourists. The government is also taking aim at more unlikely markets, including Latvia, perhaps in the hope that adventurous tourists are to be found there.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"448\" data-total-count=\"3719\" itemprop=\"articleBody\" id=\"story-continues-2\">In 2010, before the political crisis, almost 15 million foreign tourists visited Egypt, officials said; last year the figure fell to 9.5 million. Most of the visitors these days are beachgoers who avoid Cairo and other cultural destinations, limiting the reach of the money they spend. But the resort business is under threat, too, after the attack on the bus in Sinai, which was quickly followed by travel warnings from several European countries.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"187\" data-total-count=\"3906\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The crisis has been a boon to a trickle of travelers who have ignored the warnings and found five-star hotel accommodations available for a song close to prime beaches and historic sites.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"400\" data-total-count=\"4306\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">At the same time, workers at Egypt\u2019s most famous attractions have had to get used to an unsettling quiet. At the pyramids in Giza, hawkers seem to outnumber tourists most mornings by about 10 to one. In the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, employees napped in their chairs one recent afternoon while a handful of people lingered around King Tutankhamen\u2019s gleaming funerary mask, unhurried by any crowds.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"367\" data-total-count=\"4673\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Outside the building, dozens of soldiers and police officers stood guard next to armored vehicles and trucks, a visible reminder of the strife that has isolated the country. Some may have been there to protect the treasures and the tourists, but many were holding tear gas launchers, ready to disperse crowds in case protesters dared to march on Tahrir Square nearby.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"543\" data-total-count=\"5216\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Egypt will hold a presidential election in three weeks, which is expected to be won by Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who led the military takeover of the government in July and then served as defense minister and de facto leader of the country. His supporters pin great hopes on his presidency, saying that the popular military leader will bring a firm hand to Egypt\u2019s spiraling crises, including the drop-off in tourism. Mr. Sisi has pointed to his background growing up in Cairo\u2019s historic districts as evidence that he understands the industry.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"372\" data-total-count=\"5588\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Some of Egypt\u2019s tour operators are skeptical, though, that the election will bring any immediate relief. In the past, tourism rebounded quickly from calamities, including deadly militant attacks on tourists, they say, but this time there is a broader loss of confidence in Egypt from overseas, a problem that clever slogans and confident leadership cannot easily repair.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"417\" data-total-count=\"6005\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">In the garden outside the museum on a recent afternoon, desperate guides chased after a group of tourists from Thailand, only to learn that the Thais needed no guides because they had brought along Egyptian friends to show them around.

                        "text": "CAIRO \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve missed you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Egypt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ministry of tourism says in its new advertising campaign, a plaintive plea for summer visitors from wealthy countries in the Persian Gulf.\n\nThat is putting it mildly. For three years now, political turmoil has scared many travelers away from Egypt, leaving millions of people whose livelihoods depend on visitors desperate for any sign of an end to the most sustained tourism crisis anyone here can recall.\n\nAt Cosmos, a 37-year-old tour company in Cairo that used to serve up to 30,000 customers a year, Khaled M. Ismail, the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s director of operations, said he had not booked a single visitor since May 2013. The company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s once-hectic headquarters are deserted most of the time: Employees come in only once a week, to pay the bills. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not expecting any business until 2015,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Ismail said, sitting alone in his office one recent weekday.\n\nThe loss of tourism has taken a disastrous toll on the economy, starving the country of income and badly needed foreign currency. Now many people in Egypt talk not just about short-term pain but long-term damage, as workers forsake years of training and experience to hunt for new jobs outside the industry, and students abandon what had been the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most promising career track.\n\nOthers, though, are holding out, nervously watching their nest eggs dwindle as they wait for things to improve. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat was saved has been spent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Raafat Ferghani Khattab, a guide in Cairo who called tourism the family business.\n\nMr. Khattab, whose grandfather showed a Swedish king the sights in the early 20th century, said tourism was \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe nerve system of the middle class.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It is not just families like his that are suffering, he said; the ripples from the crisis have affected people like the farmers who supply organic fruit to hotels, and even pharmacists with shops in resort areas. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are back to square one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nThere is little relief in sight. Egypt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political struggles turned increasingly violent after the ouster of the elected Islamist president, Mohamed Morsi, last July. Hundreds of protesters have been killed by the security services, and militants have carried out deadly attacks on soldiers, police officers and civilians. Holiday makers were directly caught up in violence for the first time in about three years in February, when militants bombed a bus filled with South Korean visitors in a Sinai resort town, killing four people.\n\nTourism officials who tried last year to persuade the world that fears about Egypt were overblown are turning now to increasingly imaginative pitches, like promoting a spiritual retreat in a Cairo park, meant to sell a country that until recently sold itself.\n\nHaving given up on trying to attract business from the United States or many European countries, officials have focused instead on Arab tourists, hoping that regional good will and nostalgia for Egypt will trump concerns about safety. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are comfortable here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rasha al-Azaizy, a tourism ministry spokeswoman, said of Arab visitors, who traditionally made up a fifth of Egypt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tourists. The government is also taking aim at more unlikely markets, including Latvia, perhaps in the hope that adventurous tourists are to be found there.\n\nIn 2010, before the political crisis, almost 15 million foreign tourists visited Egypt, officials said; last year the figure fell to 9.5 million. Most of the visitors these days are beachgoers who avoid Cairo and other cultural destinations, limiting the reach of the money they spend. But the resort business is under threat, too, after the attack on the bus in Sinai, which was quickly followed by travel warnings from several European countries.\n\nThe crisis has been a boon to a trickle of travelers who have ignored the warnings and found five-star hotel accommodations available for a song close to prime beaches and historic sites.\n\nAt the same time, workers at Egypt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most famous attractions have had to get used to an unsettling quiet. At the pyramids in Giza, hawkers seem to outnumber tourists most mornings by about 10 to one. In the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, employees napped in their chairs one recent afternoon while a handful of people lingered around King Tutankhamen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gleaming funerary mask, unhurried by any crowds.\n\nOutside the building, dozens of soldiers and police officers stood guard next to armored vehicles and trucks, a visible reminder of the strife that has isolated the country. Some may have been there to protect the treasures and the tourists, but many were holding tear gas launchers, ready to disperse crowds in case protesters dared to march on Tahrir Square nearby.\n\nEgypt will hold a presidential election in three weeks, which is expected to be won by Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who led the military takeover of the government in July and then served as defense minister and de facto leader of the country. His supporters pin great hopes on his presidency, saying that the popular military leader will bring a firm hand to Egypt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spiraling crises, including the drop-off in tourism. Mr. Sisi has pointed to his background growing up in Cairo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historic districts as evidence that he understands the industry.\n\nSome of Egypt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tour operators are skeptical, though, that the election will bring any immediate relief. In the past, tourism rebounded quickly from calamities, including deadly militant attacks on tourists, they say, but this time there is a broader loss of confidence in Egypt from overseas, a problem that clever slogans and confident leadership cannot easily repair.\n\nIn the garden outside the museum on a recent afternoon, desperate guides chased after a group of tourists from Thailand, only to learn that the Thais needed no guides because they had brought along Egyptian friends to show them around. A shopkeeper in the museum lobby stood in his stall, among maps and guidebooks no one was buying, recalling the boom years, when \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t step a foot inside this museum.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAlaa Mosaad, a 37-year-old tour operator who sat in a nearly empty patio restaurant, said he was afraid that the downturn in tourism \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill last another three or four years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Like many in the industry, Mr. Mosaad has taken up other work \u00e2\u0080\u0094 in his case, teaching German \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to pay the bills.\n\nHis colleague Mohamed Atef, 30, noted that the succession of new governments over the last few years had each promised greater stability. But for all that, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe situation of the country is getting worse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

                        "text": "SLOVYANSK, Ukraine \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Ukrainian security forces and antigovernment rebels clashed on the edges of this rebel-controlled city on Monday as the acting president, Oleksandr V. Turchynov, said roadblocks were being set up around Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capital, Kiev, because of fears of disturbances or violence during an emotionally charged holiday later in the week.\n\nAs many as 10 rebels and four soldiers were killed in the fighting, according to the official accounts from both sides, along with a woman who was shot while standing on an apartment balcony during a bloody firefight along the highway to Slovyansk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s east.\n\nBut at the end of the day the violence accomplished little for either side besides deepening resentments and anger and appearing to push the crisis further from a chance at peaceful resolution.\n\nThe rebels yielded a single checkpoint to the government, at Rybkhoz, from which they withdrew during a morning advance by a Ukrainian armored unit. But the antigovernment forces still held Slovyansk, where residents continued to fell trees and stack tires to create obstacles to any military push.\n\nThe most pitched fighting, at Semyonovka, at the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eastern border, ended with both sides pulling back with their wounded or dead, leaving behind pools of blood, burning vehicles and a gas station that was rocked by the explosion of a commercial propane tank. The fighting there also included the civilian death, which is likely to fuel the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s building sense of anger and grief.\n\nIn Kiev, the provisional government said vehicle checkpoints had been set up at strategic locations around the capital in anticipation of potential violence before a holiday on Friday commemorating victory over the Nazis in World War II.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWar is in effect being waged against us, and we must be ready to repel this aggression,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Turchynov said, announcing the roadblocks on Monday in an interview on Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Channel 5 television station.\n\nMr. Turchynov also said that Parliament would meet in a special closed session on Tuesday for a report by security agencies on measures to stabilize the country. In a statement, Mr. Turchynov urged all lawmakers to attend and said that \u00e2\u0080\u009cimportant decisions will be taken related to the security of Ukraine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe government seemed to be stepping up its efforts to counter the pro-Russian disinformation campaign that has flooded the television airwaves in the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s east and portrayed the central authorities as illegitimate. Mr. Turchynov\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office released a number of statements, including one that criticized efforts by those it called terrorists to enlist miners from eastern Ukraine in antigovernment actions.\n\nMost of the residents of Slovyansk, a small industrial city, have never experienced war, and in Khimik, a neighborhood about a mile and a half from the battle, people crowded on the upper-story balconies of an apartment building to listen and watch as the two sides clashed at an intersection beside the railway crossing in Semyonovka.\n\nThis curiosity proved fatal, according to Sergey N. Sheptenko, when his wife, Irina Boevets, 30, was struck by a bullet in the head. Mr. Sheptenko found her moments later, lying on her right side in a pool of blood.\n\nStanding with reddened eyes before his apartment door, he seemed in shock, describing a loss he had only begun to know.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no one, no one is home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he whispered, hoarsely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly silence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was not clear whether Ms. Boevets was targeted or struck by a stray bullet; her husband said he suspected a sniper.\n\nThe fighting at Semyonovka raged in the morning after rebels took up a position on the highway, one witness said. The Ukrainian government said the rebels ambushed a convoy, but the witness described it differently, saying that a patrol of armored vehicles attacked the new rebel position, killing many of them.\n\nAt a gas station near the intersection, ordnance appeared to strike a large storage tank, causing an explosion that set fire to a four-door hatchback car, knocked aside another tank and heaved debris that smashed the front end of a cargo truck.\n\nThe attendant, who said he was pressed flat to the floor as the station was rocked by the blast and hit with bullets, spoke with dismay. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how we can resolve this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat steps can the Ukrainian people take to stop the shooting? We have children.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn Andreyevka, where Ukrainian forces took a bridge and subsequently withdrew from it last week, an explosion late in the morning set the bridge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guards scrambling. Rebels crouched along walls and in the vegetation nearby, saying they had been attacked by a helicopter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNone were wounded, thank God,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Maksim, a former paratrooper who, like many fighters, withheld his last name.\n\nArsen Avakov, the acting interior minister, was present for part of the fighting, according to the Interfax-Ukraine news agency. He offered an explanation for the gradual tightening of the Ukrainian forces around Slovyansk, which he has called a blockade. While militants remain sandbagged in official buildings inside, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe only tactic is to advance little by little toward the center.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe head of Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national guard, Stepan Poltorak, was quoted as telling Agence France-Presse, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are doing all they can to make us resort to heavy weapons, but we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that in order to spare the civilian population.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn Odessa on Monday, burials began for the 46 people who died in street fighting and a fire three days before. Mourners stood around the open grave of one of the pro-Russian leaders, Vyachislav Markin, and then in turn took handfuls of black earth and cast them silently onto the coffin.\n\nRelatives sobbed and his supporters spoke of a man who had died before his time. Mr. Markin perished in the fire that burned a trade union building where pro-Russian activists had holed up after losing a street battle with pro-Ukrainian activists on Friday.\n\nWith the three-day period of mourning declared by the city ending Tuesday, Mr. Avakov, the interior minister, said he had sent a newly formed police unit called Kiev-1 from the capital to Odessa, in case fighting erupts again.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Mr. Avakov held police officials in Odessa responsible for failing to prevent a pro-Russian mob from attacking a pro-Ukrainian rally, a confrontation that touched off the violence on Friday.\n\nThe new police unit was drawn from the street activists who helped topple Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s government in February after months of demonstrations on a central plaza in Kiev in favor of closer economic ties with Europe and against corruption.\n\nMr. Avakov said he had fired the entire leadership of the Odessa police.\n\nTensions remained high in Odessa, with the sense that the street fighting of last week was not so much over as in abeyance.\n\nWith Ukrainian flags flying about town and pro-Ukrainian groups clearly stronger in the streets, it was unclear if the pro-Russian group could muster the forces to mount another struggle to seize buildings or raise Russian flags in public.\n\nPro-Russian militants angry about their dead have posted the names and addresses of pro-Ukrainian activists online to invite revenge attacks.",

Odessa is a major port between the Crimean Peninsula, annexed by Russia in March, and the Russian-backed separatist enclave of Transnistria in Moldova on Ukraine\u2019s eastern border.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"455\" data-total-count=\"2130\" itemprop=\"articleBody\" id=\"story-continues-2\">President Vladimir V. Putin, in a speech last month, hinted at a claim to an entire arc of Russian-speaking regions in the east and the south of Ukraine by calling these provinces of steppe and Black Sea coastline Novorossiya, or New Russia, as they were known after Catherine the Great\u2019s conquest of the region in the 18th century. Russia has said it does not intend to invade, though tens of thousands of its troops are still positioned on the border.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"311\" data-total-count=\"2441\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The violence on Friday and the freeing of prisoners on Sunday highlighted a distinction between Odessa and the east: In both places, the police have sided with rebels. But here, local pro-Kiev activists routinely field street fighters ready to confront the Novorossiya group, with lethal consequences on Friday.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"275\" data-total-count=\"2716\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">At the police station on Sunday, the riot police stood idly by as men and women gathered, banging on a gate and chanting, and then they demonstratively walked through the crowd led by a uniformed man wearing the black-and-orange ribbon that is a symbol of pro-Russian groups.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"118\" data-total-count=\"2834\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Soon enough, the prisoners emerged through the gate, pumping their fists in the air to chants of \u201cheroes! heroes!\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"270\" data-total-count=\"3104\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The men belong to a group known as the Activists of Kulikovo Field, which had camped out on the square of that name in Odessa. They had been in jail for two days after being rescued from the trade union building blaze that killed at least 40 other pro-Russian militants.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"254\" data-total-count=\"3358\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">After establishing a tent camp on Kulikovo Square, the activists, following the example of pro-Russian groups in Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, had proclaimed an independent state, the Republic of Novorossiya. An exile in Moscow then claimed the presidency.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"434\" data-total-count=\"3792\" itemprop=\"articleBody\" id=\"story-continues-3\">But unlike in eastern Ukraine, they faced strong opposition from pro-Ukrainian activists, including soccer fans. The fan clubs of the Chernomorets and Metalist teams, who had a long and fierce rivalry that often led to fights, recently declared a truce because of the crisis. Before a match on Friday, they scheduled a march in support of Ukrainian unity down Deribasovskaya Street, a pedestrian thoroughfare in the heart of the city.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"238\" data-total-count=\"4030\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The fighting started when the Activists of Kulikovo Field tried to block the march. Leaflets went up around Odessa on Friday morning, announcing the pro-Russian action to \u201cdefend Odessa from pogroms,\u201d and the city braced for violence.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"409\" data-total-count=\"4439\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">What followed were hours of bloody street clashes involving bats, pistols and firebombs.

Yatsenyuk, to express condolences for the dozens of people who died here on Friday in street fighting and in a horrific fire at a trade union building, and to reinforce the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s narrative that Russia and inept or disloyal local police were to blame.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference, Mr. Yatsenyuk cast aspersion on the police, suggesting that if they had done their jobs instead of concentrating on soliciting bribes at an outdoor market, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthese terrorist organizations would have been foiled.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere were dozens of casualties resulting from a well-prepared and organized action against people, against Ukraine and against Odessa,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Yatsenyuk said, speaking at the news conference on Sunday morning, western and Ukrainian news media reported. He denounced Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s claim that Ukraine was not seeking a compromise with its Russian-speakers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe process of dialogue had begun, only it was drowned out by the sound of shooting from automatic rifles of Russian production,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nMr. Yatsenyuk said the violence showed that Russia wanted to kindle unrest in Odessa, as it had in eastern Ukrainian cities. Odessa is a major port between the Crimean Peninsula, annexed by Russia in March, and the Russian-backed separatist enclave of Transnistria in Moldova on Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eastern border.\n\nPresident Vladimir V. Putin, in a speech last month, hinted at a claim to an entire arc of Russian-speaking regions in the east and the south of Ukraine by calling these provinces of steppe and Black Sea coastline Novorossiya, or New Russia, as they were known after Catherine the Great\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conquest of the region in the 18th century. Russia has said it does not intend to invade, though tens of thousands of its troops are still positioned on the border.\n\nThe violence on Friday and the freeing of prisoners on Sunday highlighted a distinction between Odessa and the east: In both places, the police have sided with rebels. But here, local pro-Kiev activists routinely field street fighters ready to confront the Novorossiya group, with lethal consequences on Friday.\n\nAt the police station on Sunday, the riot police stood idly by as men and women gathered, banging on a gate and chanting, and then they demonstratively walked through the crowd led by a uniformed man wearing the black-and-orange ribbon that is a symbol of pro-Russian groups.\n\nSoon enough, the prisoners emerged through the gate, pumping their fists in the air to chants of \u00e2\u0080\u009cheroes! heroes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe men belong to a group known as the Activists of Kulikovo Field, which had camped out on the square of that name in Odessa. They had been in jail for two days after being rescued from the trade union building blaze that killed at least 40 other pro-Russian militants.\n\nAfter establishing a tent camp on Kulikovo Square, the activists, following the example of pro-Russian groups in Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, had proclaimed an independent state, the Republic of Novorossiya. An exile in Moscow then claimed the presidency.\n\nBut unlike in eastern Ukraine, they faced strong opposition from pro-Ukrainian activists, including soccer fans. The fan clubs of the Chernomorets and Metalist teams, who had a long and fierce rivalry that often led to fights, recently declared a truce because of the crisis. Before a match on Friday, they scheduled a march in support of Ukrainian unity down Deribasovskaya Street, a pedestrian thoroughfare in the heart of the city.\n\nThe fighting started when the Activists of Kulikovo Field tried to block the march. Leaflets went up around Odessa on Friday morning, announcing the pro-Russian action to \u00e2\u0080\u009cdefend Odessa from pogroms,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the city braced for violence.\n\nWhat followed were hours of bloody street clashes involving bats, pistols and firebombs. Many in the pro-Russian group carried bowie knives, photographs show. Four people died on and around Deribasovskaya Street. The pro-Russians, outnumbered by the Ukrainians, fell back, abandoning their tent camp on Kulikovo Square, which was burned by their opponents. Many then sought refuge in the trade union building.\n\nYanus Milteynus, a 42-year-old construction worker and pro-Russian activist, said he watched from the roof as the pro-Ukrainian crowd threw firebombs into the building\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lower windows, while those inside feared being beaten to death by the crowd if they tried to flee.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSome people jumped or tried to run away, but they chased them and beat them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Videos of the inferno, however, also show pro-Ukrainian activists trying to move scaffolding from a stage to the building, to rescue those inside.\n\nOnly when the police managed to form a cordon to escort out those rescued by firefighters was he able to leave. If the roof caught fire before then, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would have stayed and sizzled like a sausage in a frying pan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe conflict is hardening hearts on both sides. As the building burned, Ukrainian activists sang the Ukrainian national anthem, witnesses on both sides said. They also hurled a new taunt: \u00e2\u0080\u009cColorado\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the Colorado potato beetle, striped red and black like the pro-Russian ribbons. Those outside chanted \u00e2\u0080\u009cburn Colorado, burn,\u00e2\u0080\u009d witnesses said. Swastikalike symbols were spray painted on the building, along with graffiti reading \u00e2\u0080\u009cGalician SS,\u00e2\u0080\u009d though it was unclear when it had appeared, or who had painted it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe biggest thing they ever did to make me hate this country was sing the anthem,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Milteynus said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was going to die, and they sang the anthem. I hate them deeply.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn an embarrassment for the Ukrainian Army, separatists tricked five soldiers at a checkpoint outside the eastern city of Mariupol into eating food laced with a sleeping potion, then they returned half an hour later and captured the dazed men with their weapons, the Ukrainian military confirmed on Sunday, saying it had issued new regulations limiting what soldiers can accept from apparently friendly civilians. The soldiers were released after negotiations Saturday.\n\nThe United States ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey R.

Amid the chaos, which included the lobbing of firebombs, it was not immediately clear who had started the blaze, though a report from a pro-Ukraine national newspaper, Ukrainska Pravda, suggested that Ukrainian activists had done nothing to help those inside. \u201cAs the building burned, the Ukrainian activists continued to scream mottos about Putin and sing the Ukrainian national anthem,\u201d the article said, referring to President Vladimir V.

                        "text": "KIEV, Ukraine \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s security forces pressed their assault to try to reclaim the pro-Russian stronghold of Slovyansk on Saturday, even as the rebels freed seven European military observers and the Kremlin cited the deaths of dozens of people in Odessa as proof that Ukraine could no longer protect its citizens.\n\nThe Ukrainian troops built on recent advances into Slovyansk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outskirts, entering the neighboring town of Kramatorsk after firefights with armed rebels. The Interior Ministry said the forces had recaptured the main state security building there and a television tower for the town, allowing for the resumption of Ukrainian television broadcasts that had been replaced by Russian ones.\n\nBut even with the military advances, the violence on Friday in Odessa, far west of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s restive eastern region, was a measure of how far events have spiraled out of the authorities\u00e2\u0080\u0099 control. It also added to pressure from Russia, which has long said it could intervene in Ukraine if it believed Russian-leaning residents were in danger. Odessa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s population includes many Russian speakers sympathetic to Moscow.\n\nAn official in the city said 46 people had died as a result of street battles between pro-Russia and pro-Ukraine groups; many of the dead were pro-Russia militants who had retreated into a trade union building that was then set on fire. If confirmed, the death toll would be the highest since the struggles in February between pro-Europe demonstrators and the pro-Russia Ukrainian government of the ousted President Viktor F. Yanukovych.\n\nUntil Friday, Odessa, a Black Sea port in southern Ukraine, had been mostly calm. Amid the chaos, which included the lobbing of firebombs, it was not immediately clear who had started the blaze, though a report from a pro-Ukraine national newspaper, Ukrainska Pravda, suggested that Ukrainian activists had done nothing to help those inside. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs the building burned, the Ukrainian activists continued to scream mottos about Putin and sing the Ukrainian national anthem,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the article said, referring to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.\n\nMost victims were apparently overcome by smoke or burned, but several were reported to have died leaping from the flames.\n\nUkraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Foreign Ministry blamed the day of violence on provocateurs \u00e2\u0080\u009cpaid generously by the Russian special services,\u00e2\u0080\u009d while Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Foreign Ministry blamed a Ukrainian nationalist group, Right Sector.\n\nIhor Borshulyak, the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s regional prosecutor, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that 144 people had been arrested and that one of several inquiries would look into whether the police had failed to execute their duties. Interior Minister Arsen Avakov fired the local police chief on Saturday.\n\nThe European Union called for an independent investigation into the deaths, and Secretary of State John Kerry said that the United States condemned violence by militant groups on all sides. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat includes the violence of anyone who lit a fire and caused the death of those 38 people or more in the building in Odessa,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nMoscow used the violence in Odessa to again denounce the idea of holding nationwide elections in Ukraine on May 25 to select a new president and vote on constitutional reforms. A Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry S. Peskov, said any discussion of proceeding with the vote would be \u00e2\u0080\u009cabsurd.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The United States and Germany have threatened new sanctions against Russia if it disrupts the elections.\n\nMr. Peskov also said Russia would no longer be able to tell the hundreds of Russian speakers who he said were calling for help not to take up arms when there was \u00e2\u0080\u009ca direct threat to their lives.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe authorities in Kiev are not only directly responsible, they are direct accomplices in these criminal actions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTheir hands are full of blood.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Peskov said the United States and the European Union also bore some responsibility for the violence, because of what he called their endorsement of Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s military operations against pro-Russia activists.\n\nOn Russian state-run television on Saturday, leading politicians and commentators said repeatedly that war crimes were being committed and that victims in Ukraine needed protection. But despite that steady public drumbeat, and the vigor of Mr. Peskov\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statements, analysts said the Kremlin did not seem poised to intervene militarily at this point.\n\nDmitri V. Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, said he believed that Mr. Putin was aware of the high costs of a war to take control of economically troubled Ukraine.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is much more likely to wait, rather than jump the gun to intervene,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Trenin said. In pressuring Ukraine to put off the presidential election, he said, the Kremlin might be banking on the West eventually growing weary of the conflict, allowing Moscow to use its influence to shape a government more to its liking.\n\nAll the leading candidates for president visited Odessa on Saturday, expressing sympathy and sorrow for those who died.\n\nIn the east, the troops and armored vehicles advancing toward Slovyansk on Saturday tightened their cordon by taking over checkpoints on roads that lead to the town, positioning themselves beside newly tilled fields and orchards in bloom.\n\nVladimir Keruchenko, a pro-Russia militant interviewed at a checkpoint, said shots had been fired from the heavy cannons on the Ukrainian Army\u00e2\u0080\u0099s armored vehicles, though that could not be confirmed.

With helicopters flying along the city\u2019s edge, troops and armored personnel carriers approached the city from multiple sides. The fighting was brief and then sporadic, however, and clashes subsided by early afternoon, before resuming at night.

With helicopters flying along the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edge, troops and armored personnel carriers approached the city from multiple sides. The fighting was brief and then sporadic, however, and clashes subsided by early afternoon, before resuming at night. When movements stopped the Ukrainian troops had advanced, capturing and holding separatist checkpoints and posting infantry and armored vehicles on a bridge overlooking rail lines by the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s southern border.\n\nViolence also erupted Friday in the previously calmer port city of Odessa, on the Black Sea, where dozens of people died in a fire related to clashes that broke out between protesters holding a march for Ukrainian unity and pro-Russian activists. The fighting itself left four dead and 12 wounded, Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Interior Ministry said. Ukrainian and Russian news media showed images of buildings and debris burning, fire bombs being assembled and men armed with pistols.\n\nThe deaths expand the increasingly violent struggle for control over Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Black Sea port, which had been quiet until last week, when seven people were wounded in a roadside bombing.\n\nThe government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions in Slovyansk drew an immediate and indignant protest from the Kremlin, which said Ukraine had effectively destroyed a plan negotiated last month with the United States, Russia, Ukraine and the European Union intended to de-escalate tensions.\n\nBlaming the authorities in Kiev, Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capital, a spokesman for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Dmitri S. Peskov, told Russian news agencies that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Kiev regime ordered combat aircraft to fire at civilian towns and villages, launching a punitive operation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMoscow repeated its warning that it reserved the right to intervene to protect its interests and Russian-leaning residents of eastern Ukraine. But there were no signs of an imminent move across the border.\n\nThe Russian ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly I. Churkin, speaking in New York, described Ukrainian military operations as \u00e2\u0080\u009cpunitive\u00e2\u0080\u009d and said there were English-speaking foreigners among what he called \u00e2\u0080\u009cultranationalist groups\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Slovyansk. He accused his Western rivals of double standards, noting that while they had called on Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, to exercise restraint, they condoned the use of force by the current leaders in Kiev.\n\nThe United States ambassador, Samantha Power, accused Russia of spreading lies, and described Ukraine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reaction to Russian provocation as \u00e2\u0080\u009creasonable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Ukrainian people and government have embarked on an effort today to reclaim one city in the eastern part of their country,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTheir response is reasonable, it is proportional, and frankly it is what any one of our countries would have done in the face of this threat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Ukrainian army units in Slovyansk did not seem eager to engage the militants fully, and appeared to limit their activities for the day to tightening a cordon around the militant stronghold. The city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s center remained under the control of antigovernment militias, who manned barricades as streets fell nearly silent ahead of what residents feared could become a general assault.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are coming at us from all sides,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one fighter in camouflage and sneakers, who gave his name as Sergei, and who held a Kalashnikov assault rifle and said he was a veteran of the Soviet Army.\n\nBoth the government and the separatist forces said two helicopters were brought down in the fighting, with at least one crew member killed. These reports could not be verified, and hours later the wreckage had not been found by independent observers.\n\nLate at night, the Ukrainian government said two members of an airborne brigade had been killed, apparently in the brief but intense evening clash at the bridge, which by day had been held by airborne troops.\n\nEarlier, as the first round of fighting died down, Ukrainian troops were posted at their newly captured positions in the villages of Bylbasovka and Andreyevka on the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perimeter, where residents flocked to argue with them and urge them not to fight.\n\nIn Bylbasovka, a Ukrainian serviceman who identified himself as a staff officer for one of the battalions participating in the operation stood with troops facing about 75 angry residents who demanded that they leave.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe came to prevent further destabilization of the situation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the officer, who gave a first name, Vitaly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have nothing against peaceful citizens.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe residents argued with the troops standing at the front rank, at one point chanting, \u00e2\u0080\u009cShame!

Specialists said the volatility surrounding Ukraine has clearly aggravated Russia\u2019s economic problems by sapping international confidence, punishing its credit standing and increasing investor wariness, but it is not clear how much of that stems specifically from the sanctions.</p><figure id=\"ukraine-300-promo\" class=\"interactive  has-adjacency has-lede-adjacency limit-small layout-small\">\n    <a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-5\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n    <figcaption class=\"interactive-caption\">\n            <h2 class=\"interactive-headline\">\n            Ukraine Crisis in Maps        </h2>\n                <p class=\"interactive-leadin\">\n            A visual survey of the continuing dispute with maps showing political, cultural and economic factors in the crisis.        </p>\n        </figcaption>\n    \n    <p class=\"footer\">\n        \n        \n            </p>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"420\" data-total-count=\"1511\" itemprop=\"articleBody\" id=\"story-continues-5\">Just this week, the International Monetary Fund lowered its growth projection for Russia for the year to 0.2 percent and declared that the country is in recession, citing the uncertainty of the confrontation with the West. But the fund\u2019s top Moscow official attributed the slowdown as much to the fear of more sweeping sanctions that may be imposed in the future as to the impact of the limited measures taken to date.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"315\" data-total-count=\"1826\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">That uncertainty may represent the real impact of sanctions, according to experts and Obama administration officials. In addition to the shrinking growth projections, Russia recently had its credit rating downgraded to just above junk status, and investors are demanding higher interest rates to hold Russian bonds.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"349\" data-total-count=\"2175\" itemprop=\"articleBody\" id=\"story-continues-2\">Administration officials said it would be a mistake to assume those negative developments are unconnected to sanctions simply because only a relative handful of Russians have been targeted by them. The president\u2019s threat to escalate with sanctions against whole sectors of the Russian economy has been an important factor, too, the officials said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"298\" data-total-count=\"2473\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u201cOne of the purposes of sanctions is to create uncertainty and to create the expectation in the marketplace that worse could be coming,\u201d said David S. Cohen, the Treasury Department under secretary who oversees sanctions. \u201cThat uncertainty has led the market to punish the Russian economy.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"329\" data-total-count=\"2802\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Mr. Obama\u2019s approach to sanctions has generated a fierce debate in Washington. The president argues that his measured strategy has sent a potent signal while preserving a united front with hesitant European allies and holding more powerful sanctions in reserve in case Mr. Putin orders a full-scale invasion of eastern Ukraine.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"436\" data-total-count=\"3238\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Some lawmakers and Russia specialists in both parties, however, argue that his approach has been too measured. \u201cIf they named two or three big financial institutions, that would have had a big impact,\u201d said Steven Pifer, a former ambassador to Ukraine, who is now at the Brookings Institution. \u201cThey say they don\u2019t want to shoot all the bullets at once. They could have shot some more bullets and still had plenty in reserve.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"361\" data-total-count=\"3599\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The current American sanctions target 30 government officials and business leaders, as well as some of their companies. While some small Russian banks will have to stop taking Visa or MasterCard, the sanctions have not stopped major transactions or projects by those targeted. It is not clear whether the targets even have assets in the United States to freeze.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"372\" data-total-count=\"3971\" itemprop=\"articleBody\" id=\"story-continues-3\">Beyond the targets themselves, large companies like Exxon Mobil, Boeing, Royal Dutch Shell, Siemens and BP have done nothing to curtail operations in Russia. The chief executives of Shell and Siemens even met separately with Mr. Putin in recent weeks, making clear business will continue, although Shell has since added that it will hold off starting new projects for now.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"452\" data-total-count=\"4423\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Exxon Mobil and BP are partners with Rosneft, the Russian state <a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/energy-environment/oil-petroleum-and-gasoline/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\" title=\"More articles about oil.\" class=\"meta-classifier\">oil</a> company led by Igor I. Sechin, who is on the American sanctions list, but both companies can continue working with Rosneft because Rosneft itself was not targeted. Just this week, the Austrian energy company OMV made a pipeline deal with the Russian company Gazprom while Germany said it would not block the sale of RWE\u2019s oil and gas unit to the Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"362\" data-total-count=\"4785\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">\u201cThe sanctions news has had little additional impact,\u201d said Christopher J. Weafer, a founding partner in Macro Advisory and a longtime financial analyst in Moscow. \u201cBut most investors are staying away from Russia for now. They are waiting until there is a clearer picture of the trend in the economy and the effect on earnings over this year and longer.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"486\" data-total-count=\"5271\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">At a meeting in Moscow this week that included American Embassy officials and business representatives, there was little clarity about what was allowed under the current sanctions, and some executives concluded that they would err on the side of caution, an attitude that could effectively enhance the impact of sanctions. One participant said American officials recommended that chief executives not attend an economic forum in St. Petersburg this month that is important to Mr. Putin.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"213\" data-total-count=\"5484\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Russia\u2019s economy was already slowing last fall. The Moscow government shifted from a stimulus spending strategy to a money supply strategy to try to reduce borrowing rates as a way to increase business activity.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"261\" data-total-count=\"5745\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">The ruble started to depreciate sharply in January, long before Russia intervened in Ukraine, but the annexation of Crimea accelerated the drop as well as capital flight. Russia\u2019s central bank intervened by raising key rates to control the slide in the ruble.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"443\" data-total-count=\"6188\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">By the time Mr. Obama imposed his first sanctions on March 17, the fall of the ruble and markets had stabilized. The ruble, trading at 36.57 to the dollar before the sanctions, improved to 35.64 to the dollar on Thursday. The Micex stock market index closed at 1,237.43 the Friday before the first sanctions and was up to 1,306.01 on Thursday. Goldman Sachs estimated capital flight out of Russia at $50 billion before Mr. Obama\u2019s sanctions.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"264\" data-total-count=\"6452\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Obama administration officials said the expectation of sanctions had already been factored into the market by that point, and they noted that even Mr. Putin had said the sanctions were causing damage, although he said the impact was \u201cof no critical character.\u201d</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"284\" data-total-count=\"6736\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Timothy M. Frye, director of the Harriman Institute at Columbia University, said the Russian economy was declining even without sanctions. \u201cBut it\u2019s wrong to say that sanctions are not having any impact in Russia and that the Russian government can easily ignore them,\u201d he said.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"354\" data-total-count=\"7090\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Still, Mr. Frye said Mr. Putin can now shift blame. \u201cThe sanctions do give the Russian government an excuse, a scapegoat for the poor economic performance,\u201d he said. Russian officials are already saying its tough economic times \u201care due to the West\u2019s nefarious activities, when in reality the underlying problems are Russia\u2019s bad governance.\u201d</p>    \n     \n\n                <footer class=\"story-footer story-content\">\n    <div class=\"story-meta\">\n                <div class=\"story-notes\"><p>Peter Baker reported from Washington, and Andrew E.

                        "text": "WASHINGTON \u00e2\u0080\u0094 As it tries to punish Moscow for its intervention in Ukraine, the White House asserts that the sanctions it has imposed have had a \u00e2\u0080\u009csignificant impact\u00e2\u0080\u009d on Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy, but their real effect so far, according to economic specialists, appears to be more psychological than tangible.\n\nWhite House officials have pointed to the fall of the Russian ruble and Moscow stock markets as evidence of the success they have had in pressuring the Kremlin. Yet the ruble and Russian markets fell before President Obama began imposing sanctions. Today, in fact, both the ruble and the markets are slightly stronger than they were before the first sanctions were announced.\n\nRussia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic downturn predated any action by the United States or Europe and, to some extent, predated the Ukraine crisis. Specialists said the volatility surrounding Ukraine has clearly aggravated Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic problems by sapping international confidence, punishing its credit standing and increasing investor wariness, but it is not clear how much of that stems specifically from the sanctions.\n\nJust this week, the International Monetary Fund lowered its growth projection for Russia for the year to 0.2 percent and declared that the country is in recession, citing the uncertainty of the confrontation with the West. But the fund\u00e2\u0080\u0099s top Moscow official attributed the slowdown as much to the fear of more sweeping sanctions that may be imposed in the future as to the impact of the limited measures taken to date.\n\nThat uncertainty may represent the real impact of sanctions, according to experts and Obama administration officials. In addition to the shrinking growth projections, Russia recently had its credit rating downgraded to just above junk status, and investors are demanding higher interest rates to hold Russian bonds.\n\nAdministration officials said it would be a mistake to assume those negative developments are unconnected to sanctions simply because only a relative handful of Russians have been targeted by them. The president\u00e2\u0080\u0099s threat to escalate with sanctions against whole sectors of the Russian economy has been an important factor, too, the officials said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne of the purposes of sanctions is to create uncertainty and to create the expectation in the marketplace that worse could be coming,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said David S. Cohen, the Treasury Department under secretary who oversees sanctions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat uncertainty has led the market to punish the Russian economy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approach to sanctions has generated a fierce debate in Washington. The president argues that his measured strategy has sent a potent signal while preserving a united front with hesitant European allies and holding more powerful sanctions in reserve in case Mr. Putin orders a full-scale invasion of eastern Ukraine.\n\nSome lawmakers and Russia specialists in both parties, however, argue that his approach has been too measured. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf they named two or three big financial institutions, that would have had a big impact,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Steven Pifer, a former ambassador to Ukraine, who is now at the Brookings Institution. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey say they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to shoot all the bullets at once. They could have shot some more bullets and still had plenty in reserve.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe current American sanctions target 30 government officials and business leaders, as well as some of their companies. While some small Russian banks will have to stop taking Visa or MasterCard, the sanctions have not stopped major transactions or projects by those targeted. It is not clear whether the targets even have assets in the United States to freeze.\n\nBeyond the targets themselves, large companies like Exxon Mobil, Boeing, Royal Dutch Shell, Siemens and BP have done nothing to curtail operations in Russia. The chief executives of Shell and Siemens even met separately with Mr. Putin in recent weeks, making clear business will continue, although Shell has since added that it will hold off starting new projects for now.\n\nExxon Mobil and BP are partners with Rosneft, the Russian state oil company led by Igor I. Sechin, who is on the American sanctions list, but both companies can continue working with Rosneft because Rosneft itself was not targeted. Just this week, the Austrian energy company OMV made a pipeline deal with the Russian company Gazprom while Germany said it would not block the sale of RWE\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oil and gas unit to the Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe sanctions news has had little additional impact,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Christopher J. Weafer, a founding partner in Macro Advisory and a longtime financial analyst in Moscow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut most investors are staying away from Russia for now. They are waiting until there is a clearer picture of the trend in the economy and the effect on earnings over this year and longer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt a meeting in Moscow this week that included American Embassy officials and business representatives, there was little clarity about what was allowed under the current sanctions, and some executives concluded that they would err on the side of caution, an attitude that could effectively enhance the impact of sanctions. One participant said American officials recommended that chief executives not attend an economic forum in St. Petersburg this month that is important to Mr. Putin.\n\nRussia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy was already slowing last fall. The Moscow government shifted from a stimulus spending strategy to a money supply strategy to try to reduce borrowing rates as a way to increase business activity.\n\nThe ruble started to depreciate sharply in January, long before Russia intervened in Ukraine, but the annexation of Crimea accelerated the drop as well as capital flight. Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s central bank intervened by raising key rates to control the slide in the ruble.\n\nBy the time Mr. Obama imposed his first sanctions on March 17, the fall of the ruble and markets had stabilized. The ruble, trading at 36.57 to the dollar before the sanctions, improved to 35.64 to the dollar on Thursday. The Micex stock market index closed at 1,237.43 the Friday before the first sanctions and was up to 1,306.01 on Thursday. Goldman Sachs estimated capital flight out of Russia at $50 billion before Mr. Obama\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sanctions.\n\nObama administration officials said the expectation of sanctions had already been factored into the market by that point, and they noted that even Mr. Putin had said the sanctions were causing damage, although he said the impact was \u00e2\u0080\u009cof no critical character.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTimothy M. Frye, director of the Harriman Institute at Columbia University, said the Russian economy was declining even without sanctions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong to say that sanctions are not having any impact in Russia and that the Russian government can easily ignore them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nStill, Mr. Frye said Mr. Putin can now shift blame. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe sanctions do give the Russian government an excuse, a scapegoat for the poor economic performance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Russian officials are already saying its tough economic times \u00e2\u0080\u009care due to the West\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nefarious activities, when in reality the underlying problems are Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bad governance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",
