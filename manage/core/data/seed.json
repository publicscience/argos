Power, winner of a Pulitzer Prize for a book critical of the U.S. response to humanitarian crises, announced that U.S. military liaisons will soon be dispatched to help train the African Union soldiers who have joined French troops in a peacekeeping effort. She also said the United States will contribute $15 million in humanitarian aid, in addition to up to $100 million already pledged, to stem the crisis. The assistance is being offered even though the United States does not have significant financial or national security interests in the Central African Republic. Power\u2019s trip served to raise international awareness of tit-for-tat atrocities committed against civilians by warring Muslim and Christian militias. In a series of high-level meetings and phone calls, she also sought to pressure the nation\u2019s wobbly transitional government to take steps toward reconciliation, disarmament and scheduling elections no later than February 2015.Human-rights groups have estimated that at least 500 people have been killed in a spasm of retribution killings carried out by rival Muslim and Christian militias. During her visit Thursday, Power heard from a Muslim woman who said militiamen hacked her husband with machetes, doused him with gasoline and set him on fire in front of her. Power also heard from Christians victimized by Muslim militias. U.S. officials estimate that more than 400,000 people \u2014 nearly one-tenth of the country\u2019s population \u2014 have been displaced. While Power met privately with transitional government officials at the airport, hundreds lined up to receive medical treatment nearby. Donaldo Bandasa, 42, a porter, showed doctors the machete wounds carved into his scalp and shin. For all his injuries, he was one of the lucky ones. Bandasa says he saw thugs from the predominantly Muslim militia known as Seleka slash the throats of his mother, father and son after wrongly accusing them of sympathizing with the previous non-Muslim government. \u201cI can\u2019t go home because my house has been burned and looted,\u201d he said.Two U.S. military C-17 aircraft are transporting troops from Burundi into the Central African Republic to bolster an African Union force that is planned to grow to 6,000. Cheers went up from the encampment just beyond the runway as one of the giant planes disgorged a load of crisply dressed Burundian soldiers.\u201cSomalia taught us what can happen in a failed state, and Rwanda showed us what could occur in a deeply divided one,\u201d Power said. \u201cThe people of the Central African Republic are in profound danger and we all have a responsibility to help them move away from the abyss.\u201d Power said that \u201curgent action is required to save lives.\u201dThe conflict stems from the March coup d\u2019etat that ousted longtime Central African Republic leader Gen. Fran\u00e7ois Boziz\u00e9, whose regime was plagued by allegations of corruption. The patchwork of mostly Muslim militias known as Seleka, or \u201calliance,\u201d toppled the government of this predominantly Christian nation, spurred in part by claims that Boziz\u00e9\u2019s government had not done enough for the northern Muslims. Seleka, which includes mercenaries from nearby nations such as Chad, installed Michel Djotodia as transitional president. In response to the attacks, Christian militias known as Anti-Balaka, meaning \u201canti-machete,\u201d have formed and are targeting Muslim communities in retribution. Their name is a reference to Seleka\u2019s weapon of choice: the machete. Power on Thursday met with humanitarian and religious leaders who said the conflict has been especially disconcerting because the Central African Republic had previously been known as a place of religious harmony.Djotodia\u2019s actions have drawn disapproval from the United Nations and from U.S. officials. He has tried to oust three high-ranking ministers, a move that U.S. officials say is a violation of the transitional government charter. He has also stunned international observers by awarding military and police jobs to 5,000 Seleka militia members, some of whom may have been involved in atrocities. Djotodia claims to have control of the nation, but U.S. officials are dubious that his authority reaches beyond Bangui. Late Thursday, Power said that Djotodia, the nation\u2019s prime minister and other top transitional government officials privately reaffirmed their commitments to step down after the 2015 elections. \u201cWe, the international community, are going to hold them to it,\u201d Power said. She also urged officials here to employ national and international commissions of inquiry to hold accountable those responsible for atrocities.Outside the capital, tens of thousands of Christians and Muslims have fled to crowded shelters in the interior city of Bossangoa, Doctors Without Borders\u2019 Ellen van der Velden said in a telephone interview from that city this week. A half-mile stretch of the city has been all but abandoned as nearly 40,000 Christians have sought shelter at a Roman Catholic church on one side of the city while thousands of Muslims have retreated to a neighborhood on the opposite side. Thousands more are believed to be hiding in the malaria-infested bush. Doctors Without Borders has issued a scathing open letter criticizing the U.N. response to the crisis, saying it has done little more than collect data and hold coordination meetings. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the international response falls short of the needs,\u201d van der Velden said. \u201cWe had expected more than we have seen so far.\u201dU.S. officials have rejected that criticism, saying a collaborative response is underway. In background briefings, U.S. officials have said the United States and the international community have a \u201cmoral interest\u201d in intervening to stop the violence.The Central African Republic is a former French colony. The French government has taken the lead on the ground, dispatching more than 1,000 of its soldiers to the nation for peacekeeping operations. Two have been killed.\u201cThe potential for further mass violence is shockingly high,\u201d said Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch, which is calling on the United Nations to dispatch its own peacekeeping operation to the country. U.S. officials have defended the current approach using African Union and French troops, saying it is quicker and less expensive than mounting a full-scale U.N. peacekeeping operation.

But to liberal activists, he\u2019s not going far enough. Ju Hong's voice rang out loud and clear, interrupting the most powerful man in the world. Skip to next paragraph Subscribe Today to the Monitor Click Here for your FREE 30 DAYS ofThe Christian Science MonitorWeekly Digital Edition \"You have a power to stop deportation for all undocumented immigrants in this country!\" the young South Korean man yelled at President Obama during a speech on immigration reform last November in San Francisco. Waving away security guards, Mr. Obama turned and addressed Mr. Hong, himself undocumented. \"Actually, I don't,\" the president said. \"And that's why we're here.\"\"We've got this Constitution, we've got this whole thing about separation of powers,\" Obama continued. \"So there is no shortcut to politics, and there's no shortcut to democracy.\"The reality isn't so simple. Obama, a former constitutional law lecturer, was once skeptical of the aggressive use of presidential power. During the 2008 campaign, he accused President George W. Bush of regularly circumventing Congress. Yet as president, Obama has grown increasingly bold in his own use of executive action, at times to controversial effect. The president (or his administration) has unilaterally changed elements of the Affordable Care Act (ACA); declared an anti-gay-rights law unconstitutional; lifted the threat of deportation for an entire class of undocumented immigrants; bypassed Senate confirmation of controversial nominees; waived compliance requirements in education law; and altered the work requirements under welfare reform. This month, the Obama administration took the highly unusual step of announcing that it will recognize gay marriages performed in Utah \u2013 even though Utah itself says it will not recognize them while the issue is pending in court.Early in his presidency, Obama also expanded presidential warmaking powers, surveillance of the American public, and extrajudicial drone strikes on alleged terrorists outside the United States, including Americans \u2013 going beyond Mr. Bush's own global war on terror following 9/11. But more recently, he has flexed his executive muscle more on domestic policy.In the process, Obama's claims of executive authority have infuriated opponents, while emboldening supporters to demand more on a range of issues, from immigration and gay rights to the minimum wage and Guant\u00e1namo Bay prison camp.To critics, Obama is the ultimate \"imperial president,\" willfully violating the Constitution to further his goals, having failed to convince Congress of the merits of his arguments. To others, he is exercising legitimate executive authority in the face of an intransigent Congress and in keeping with the practices of past presidents.The course of Obama's final three years in office, in which he has promised continuing assertive use of executive action, will be shaped by this debate.The tug of historyOn the eve of Obama's fifth State of the Union message, on Jan. 28, the president faces a steep challenge. His job approval has plummeted to the low 40s, following the disastrous rollout of his health-care reform and public outrage over massive data collection by the National Security Agency.

Obama, a former constitutional law lecturer, was once skeptical of the aggressive use of presidential power. During the 2008 campaign, he accused <a href=\"/tags/topic/George+W.+Bush\" title=\"Title: George W. Bush\" target=\"_self\" class=\"inform_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">President George W. Bush</a> of regularly circumventing Congress. Yet as president, Obama has grown increasingly bold in his own use of executive action, at times to controversial effect.</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The president (or his administration) has unilaterally changed elements of the <a href=\"/tags/topic/Patient+Protection+and+Affordable+Care+Act\" title=\"Title: Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\" target=\"_self\" class=\"inform_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">Affordable Care Act</a> (ACA); declared an anti-gay-rights law unconstitutional; lifted the threat of deportation for an entire class of undocumented immigrants; bypassed Senate confirmation of controversial nominees; waived compliance requirements in education law; and altered the work requirements under welfare reform. This month, the Obama administration took the highly unusual step of announcing that it will recognize gay marriages performed in Utah \u2013 even though Utah itself says it will not recognize them while the issue is pending in court.</p><p>Early in his presidency, Obama also expanded presidential warmaking powers, surveillance of the American public, and extrajudicial drone strikes on alleged terrorists outside the United States, including Americans \u2013 going beyond Mr. Bush's own global war on terror following 9/11. But more recently, he has flexed his executive muscle more on domestic policy.</p><p>In the process, Obama's claims of executive authority have infuriated opponents, while emboldening supporters to demand more on a range of issues, from immigration and gay rights to the minimum wage and Guant\u00e1namo Bay prison camp.</p><p>To critics, Obama is the ultimate \"imperial president,\" willfully violating the Constitution to further his goals, having failed to convince Congress of the merits of his arguments. To others, he is exercising legitimate executive authority in the face of an intransigent Congress and in keeping with the practices of past presidents.</p><p>The course of Obama's final three years in office, in which he has promised continuing assertive use of executive action, will be shaped by this debate.</p><p><b>The tug of history</b></p><p>On the eve of Obama's fifth State of the Union message, on Jan. 28, the president faces a steep challenge. His job approval has plummeted to the low 40s, following the disastrous rollout of his health-care reform and public outrage over massive data collection by the <a href=\"/tags/topic/National+Security+Agency\" title=\"Title: National Security Agency\" target=\"_self\" class=\"inform_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">National Security Agency</a>.

Since the mid 1990s the former Spanish colony has become one of sub-Sahara's biggest oil producers and in 2004 was said to have the world's fastest-growing economy.

Oil earnings are allegedly stolen by the ruling elite International: Equatorial Guinea and Gabon are in dispute over islands in potentially oil-rich off-shore waters Country profiles compiled by BBC Monitoring Francisco Macias Nguema's reign of terror - from independence in 1968 until his overthrow in 1979 - prompted a third of the population to flee. Apart from allegedly committing genocide against the Bubi ethnic minority, he ordered the death of thousands of suspected opponents, closed down churches and presided over the economy's collapse. His successor - Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo - took over in a coup and has shown little tolerance for opposition during the three decades of his rule. While the country is nominally a multiparty democracy, elections have generally been considered a sham. According to Human Rights Watch, the ''dictatorship under President Obiang has used an oil boom to entrench and enrich itself further at the expense of the country's people''. The corruption watchdog Transparency International has put Equatorial Guinea in the top 12 of its list of most corrupt states. Resisting calls for more transparency, President Obiang has for long held that oil revenues are a state secret. In 2008 the country became a candidate of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative - an international project meant to promote openness about government oil revenues - but failed to qualify by an April 2010 deadline. A 2004 US Senate investigation into the Washington-based Riggs Bank found that President Obiang's family had received huge payments from US oil companies such as Exxon Mobil and Amerada Hess. Observers say the US finds it hard to criticise a country which is seen as an ally in a volatile, oil-rich region. In 2006, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice hailed President Obiang as a \"good friend\" despite repeated criticism of his human rights and civil liberties record by her own department. More recently President Barack Obama posed for an official photograph with President Obiang at a New York reception. The advocacy group Global Witness has been lobbying the United States to act against the President Obiang's son Teodor, a government minister. It says there is credible evidence that he spent millions buying a Malibu mansion and private jet using corruptly acquired funds - grounds for denying him a visa.

The mis-selling of these sophisticated financial products is among numerous scandals facing the banking sector in recent years and the payouts come on top of more than 17 billion pounds set aside by British banks to compensate customers mis-sold loan insurance.Britain's financial regulator said on Friday 158.6 million pounds, just 5 percent of the funds set aside, had been paid in compensation by Britain's biggest four banks - Lloyds (LLOY.L), Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L), Barclays (BARC.L) and HSBC (HSBA.L) - by the end of December.That compares with 81.2 million at the end of November.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) had ordered banks to begin paying compensation last May after saying there were serious failings in the way banks sold interest-rate swaps.The products were meant to insure small businesses against the risk of higher interest rates, but when rates fell, companies were left with bills typically running into tens of thousands of pounds or facing big penalties to get out of the deals.The regulator has urged banks to get on with compensating customers, setting a deadline of May for the process to be completed, and said on Friday that banks had upped the pace since November and were working towards meeting that target.However, swaps experts raised concerns over the proportion of cases where banks didn't need to pay compensation.Daniel Hall, managing director of AllSquare, which advises companies pursuing claims, said the data showed 96 percent of swaps had been mis-sold, but only about 60 percent of completed cases had resulted in compensation.\"As these assessments and determinations are largely subjective, it raises questions about whether businesses are getting a fair rub of the green,\" Hall said.SWIFT PROGRESSThe Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said an estimated 40,000 businesses were still awaiting compensation.\"The banks must not get complacent and making swift progress in paying the remaining redress is the only way to rebuild trust,\" said FSB National Chairman John Allan.By the end of December, 18,700 small firms had been invited by banks to have their cases reviewed. A total of 1,040 offers of compensation had been accepted by customers at the end of last month, up from 547 at the end of November.

Skip to next paragraph Subscribe Today to the Monitor Click Here for your FREE 30 DAYS ofThe Christian Science MonitorWeekly Digital Edition The Constitution assigns to the president the power to appoint judges and officers of the United States, but it requires him to act with the \u201cadvice and consent\u201d of the Senate.There is an exception. The Constitution also provides that the president \u201cshall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate.\u201d Such \u201crecess appointments\u201d can take place without obtaining the advice and consent of the Senate.It is this recess appointment power that lies at the center of the historic showdown on Monday at the high court. On one side of the issue, the Obama administration argues it has the power to decide for itself when the Senate is in recess for purposes of making recess appointments.On the other side, administration critics argue that President Obama\u2019s expansive view of his own authority would \u201cyield a virtually unlimited unilateral appointments power.\u201dThe case arises at a time of extreme partisan differences in Congress that have made it increasingly difficult for President Obama to fill vacant posts in his administration. Obstructionist tactics by Republicans are not new. The same tactics were used by Democrats \u2013 including then-Senator Obama \u2013 to block or delay appointments by President Bush.But President Bush never sought to make recess appointments during pro forma Senate sessions. That action by President Obama marks a new level of executive defiance of the Senate.To some extent the urgency of the case has dissipated following the recent decision by Senate Democrats to invoke the so-called nuclear option \u2013 changing the Senate rules to permit approval of presidential appointments by majority vote rather than 60. The action undercut the ability of the Republican minority to block Obama appointments.But it does nothing to resolve the more fundamental questions involving the balance of power among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government.The high court case will require the justices not just to examine the contemporary practice of recess appointments, but to also weigh why the procedure was written into the Constitution and how the founding generation wielded that authority.\u201cNone of the first four presidents of the United States \u2013 founders and framers all \u2013 adopted the Executive\u2019s interpretation, even though it would have expanded their power,\u201d wrote Noel Francisco, a Washington appellate lawyer, in his brief challenging President Obama\u2019s recess appointments.\u201cThat is far more persuasive evidence than decades-later, self-serving executive opinions,\u201d he said.US Solicitor General Donald Verrilli responded by using examples from history as well. A court ruling in favor of the president\u2019s challengers \u201cwould repudiate the constitutional legitimacy of thousands of appointments made by at least 14 presidents since the 1860s,\u201d Mr. Verrilli wrote in his brief.\u201cThroughout our history, Presidents have made appointments in these circumstances to fill offices temporarily when the Senate was unavailable to provide its advice and consent,\u201d he said.The recess appointments in question were made on Jan. 4, 2012. Mr. Obama named three individuals to the National Labor Relations Board, which otherwise would have lacked a quorum to conduct business.He took that action on Jan. 4 even though the Senate \u2013 a day earlier \u2013 had conducted a pro-forma session formally commencing the 112th Congress. Only one Senator presided over the pro-forma session, but under past practice, the Senate was technically in session when the president made his recess appointments.The president and his lawyers disagree with those who claim the Senate was still in session. In their view, even though the Senate claimed to be session, it was actually in recess for purposes of the recess appointments clause.Administration lawyers argue that the president can make recess appointments during such pro-forma Senate sessions because, in reality, the senators are not available to consult on appointments or conduct other business.The issue reaches the high court in the context of a labor dispute at Noel Canning, a soft drink bottling and distribution company in Yakima, Washington.The dispute went to the National Labor Relations Board, which ruled in favor of Teamsters Local 760 and against Noel Canning. The NLRB panel included two of three NLRB members who had been recess-appointed by President Obama a month earlier, in January 2012.In appealing the NLRB ruling, company lawyers attacked the validity of the recess appointments and argued that the board thus lacked a quorum to conduct business at the time they issued their decision in the Noel Canning case.The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit agreed with Noel Canning that the recess appointments were invalid. The appeals court ruled that President Obama could only make recess appointments during the period between the end of one enumerated session of Congress and the beginning of another.The court rejected the administration\u2019s argument that it could make recess appointments during mid-session breaks whenever the Senate was unavailable to address presidential appointments or other business.In addition, the court ruled that the president could only use his recess appointments authority to fill vacancies that arose during the formal recess between enumerated sessions of Congress.Since the NLRB vacancies arose earlier than the formal recess (between the end of the 111th Congress in December 2011 and the beginning of the 112th Congress in January 2012), the recess appointments were unconstitutional, the appeals court ruled.Lawyers for Noel Canning raised a third issue in their appeal. They argued that the president exceeded his authority by making recess appointments while the Senate was convening every three days in pro-forma sessions. The appeals court did not rule on that question, but the Supreme Court has asked the lawyers to address it.Verrilli says that the Senate is not permitted to use pro forma sessions to unilaterally hamstring or manipulate the president\u2019s recess appointments authority.\u201cWhatever leeway the Senate may enjoy when governing its own affairs, it cannot exploit that leeway to limit the President\u2019s constitutional authority,\u201d he wrote.\u201cThe Senate\u2019s choice remains the same it has faced since the earliest days of the Republic: remain in session for the conduct of business or depart for an extended period with the knowledge that the President may temporarily fill vacant offices,\u201d Verrilli said.Mr. Francisco approaches the issue from a different perspective. It is up to the Senate, not the president, to decide when the Senate is in session.\u201cPresidents have discretion to decide whether to make recess appointments, and to select whom they appoint. But they may not also determine when that power is available,\u201d Francisco said. \u201cThat decision is for the Senate alone.\u201dThe case is National Labor Relations Board v. Noel Canning (12-1281).A decision is expected by late June.", "title": "Obama's recess appointments: Supreme Court to hear landmark case", "_id": 23074739, "tags": null, "source": "http://rss.csmonitor.com/feeds/usa", "updated": "", "html": "<html><body><div><p>Who has the authority to decide when the Senate is officially in session, the president or senators themselves?

He hopes to qualify for the upcoming Winter Olympics. Dave Sandford/Getty Images Ross Miner skates during the men's short program at the 2013 Skate Canada International last year. He hopes to qualify for the upcoming Winter Olympics. Dave Sandford/Getty Images Ross Miner is among those competing for a spot on the U.S. Men's figure skating team Friday night in Boston. He is a hometown favorite who is bringing some local flavor to his performance \u2014 he's going to tell the story of last year's Boston Marathon bombing. Miner won the silver medal at last year's U.S. championships, but he's had his challenges this year: pushing through an ankle injury to keep up his 60-hour-a week training, all in hopes of realizing his Olympic dream. In some ways, he says, tonight is easy. 'You Can Feel His Joy Of Skating' \"I'm glad it's finally here,\" Miner says \"The waiting I think is the hardest part. And once you get into the swing of it, 'OK, we're at competition now. This is normal. This is what we do.' \" Practicing this week, Miner sailed his way through a kind of ode to a childhood spent skating. Watching from the side, his mother, Gloria Miner, clenches her fist against her mouth at his every trick and tuck, while Ross just smiles his way through. \"Yes, that's Ross Miner,\" says coach Mark Mitchell. \"That's how he is on [an] everyday basis. You can feel his joy of skating, and his joy of life.\" Mitchell says Miner has always been both a determined athlete, and what his mother calls a \"hambone,\" someone who loves the spotlight. But Mitchell says this year, Miner is showing off something different. Ross Miner Stars As Himself \"He's always portrayed some kind of character: He's Humphrey Bogart or he did a surfing number,\" Mitchell says. \"This year we said he's portraying Ross Miner \u2014 he's being himself.\" Miner's long 4 1/2-minute routine tells his story of being traumatized, then buoyed by the Boston bombing, through moves and music. It starts with patriotic music \u2014 the running of the marathon itself. Then, two discordant crashes come out of nowhere. \"And then, there's a section which is to me the immediate aftermath,\" Miner says. The music slows. \"It's sort of like you're watching it in slow motion, and 'Oh my God, I can't believe this happened.' I think that was everyone's emotion at time.\" \"And then there's this very sharp immediate music, which we always talk about as like 'the manhunt.' \" That part hits hard for Miner, who was locked down at home in Watertown, where the suspects were on the loose. \"It was crazy,\" Miner says \"There're armored vehicles driving down my street. I could hear the flash-bangs going off and the helicopters were flying overhead. So it was surreal.\" \"Then really uplifting, proud, glorious music comes in ... and to me that was, you know, the pride and the relief of knowing that we got the people who did this to us, and of being safe.\" He says having such a heavy story underlie his performance is calming, in an odd way. \"This year's been a little bit up and down, and there were times when skating felt very big, and I was kind of under the weight of it,\" Miner says. \"When I get on the ice to do this program, it takes almost a little bit of the pressure off. It's like, 'OK, it's figure skating.' \" \"As stressed as I am, you know, I keep in mind all these people who have gone through so much,\" he says, \"it keeps it in perspective.\" Miner never set out to be a figure skater. He first hit the ice as a kid, playing hockey. \"My mom was like, 'You've gotta get out of the house.' I was 3 or something. And she was like, 'You're driving me nuts \u2014 go burn some energy!' \" Miner saw the figure skaters at the rink, and became hooked, though as his mother says \u2014 as with many boys in figure skating \u2014 there have been obstacles. \"Sometimes at school, they would get things like 'this isn't a sport \u2014 because you have sequins!' \" Gloria Miner says. \"You know, because it is also theater, and it is somewhat more difficult to understand for people, because of the scoring system perhaps. ... Boys have said they've gotten teased in school because it's not a sport.\" Back on the ice, Miner does a triple flip and his mother claps. \"He can do it a little better but it was good,\" she says. Because of his injuries, Ross Miner says he'll only do a triple jump, not a quad in Boston.

He is a hometown favorite who is bringing some local flavor to his performance \u2014 he's going to tell the story of last year's Boston Marathon bombing.</p>   <p>Miner won the <a href=\"http://web.icenetwork.com/skaters/profile/ross_miner\">silver medal at last year's U.S. championships</a>, but he's had his challenges this year: pushing through an ankle injury to keep up his 60-hour-a week training, all in hopes of realizing his Olympic dream.</p>   <p>In some ways, he says, tonight is easy.</p>   <p><strong>'You Can Feel His Joy Of Skating'</strong></p>   <p>\"I'm glad it's finally here,\" Miner says \"The waiting I think is the hardest part. And once you get into the swing of it, 'OK, we're at competition now. This is normal. This is what we do.' \"</p>   <p>Practicing this week, Miner sailed his way through a kind of ode to a childhood spent skating. Watching from the side, his mother, Gloria Miner, clenches her fist against her mouth at his every trick and tuck, while Ross just smiles his way through.</p>   <p>\"Yes, <em>that's</em> Ross Miner,\" says coach Mark Mitchell. \"That's how he is on [an] everyday basis. You can feel his joy of skating, and his joy of life.\"</p>   \n   \n\n   <p>Mitchell says Miner has always been both a determined athlete, and what his mother calls a \"hambone,\" someone who loves the spotlight. But Mitchell says this year, Miner is showing off something different.</p>   <p><strong>Ross Miner Stars As Himself</strong></p>   <p>\"He's always portrayed some kind of character: He's Humphrey Bogart or he did a surfing number,\" Mitchell says. \"This year we said he's portraying Ross Miner \u2014 he's being himself.\"</p>   <p>Miner's long 4 1/2-minute routine tells his story of being traumatized, then buoyed by the Boston bombing, through moves and music.</p>   <p>It starts with patriotic music \u2014 the running of the marathon itself. Then, two discordant crashes come out of nowhere.</p>   <p>\"And then, there's a section which is to me the immediate aftermath,\" Miner says. The music slows. \"It's sort of like you're watching it in slow motion, and 'Oh my God, I can't believe this happened.' I think that was everyone's emotion at time.\"</p>   <p>\"And then there's this very sharp immediate music, which we always talk about as like 'the manhunt.' \"</p>   <p>That part hits hard for Miner, who was locked down at home in Watertown, where the suspects were on the loose.</p>   <p>\"It was crazy,\" Miner says \"There're armored vehicles driving down my street. I could hear the flash-bangs going off and the helicopters were flying overhead. So it was surreal.\"</p>   <p>\"Then really uplifting, proud, glorious music comes in ... and to me that was, you know, the pride and the relief of knowing that we got the people who did this to us, and of being safe.\"</p>   <p>He says having such a heavy story underlie his performance is calming, in an odd way.</p>   <p>\"This year's been a little bit up and down, and there were times when skating felt very big, and I was kind of under the weight of it,\" Miner says. \"When I get on the ice to do this program, it takes almost a little bit of the pressure off. It's like, 'OK, it's figure skating.' \"</p>   <p>\"As stressed as I am, you know, I keep in mind all these people who have gone through so much,\" he says, \"it keeps it in perspective.\"</p>   <p>Miner never set out to be a figure skater. He first hit the ice as a kid, playing hockey.</p>   \n   \n\n   <p>\"My mom was like, 'You've gotta get out of the house.' I was 3 or something. And she was like, 'You're driving me nuts \u2014 go burn some energy!' \"</p>   <p>Miner saw the figure skaters at the rink, and became hooked, though as his mother says \u2014 as with many boys in figure skating \u2014 there have been obstacles.</p>   <p>\"Sometimes at school, they would get things like 'this isn't a sport \u2014 because you have sequins!' \" Gloria Miner says. \"You know, because it is also theater, and it is somewhat more difficult to understand for people, because of the scoring system perhaps. ... Boys have said they've gotten teased in school because it's not a sport.\"</p>   <p>Back on the ice, Miner does a triple flip and his mother claps.</p>   <p>\"He can do it a little better but it was good,\" she says.</p>   <p>Because of his injuries, Ross Miner says he'll only do a triple jump, not a quad in Boston. That'll change if he moves on to the Winter Games at Sochi, but in the meantime, even with the stakes so high, he glides through his routines looking confident and calm.</p>   <p>\"We work on looking calm, you know,\" Miner says, laughing. \"I wouldn't say I'm calm, but I'm focused and ready to do my job.\"</p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>", "author": null, "published": "Fri, 10 Jan 2014 16:42:00 -0500"}, {"url": "http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/01/14/262469168/israeli-defense-minister-slams-kerrys-efforts-in-mideast?ft=1&f=1004", "text": "hide captionU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, second right, stands with Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, left, Minister of International Relations Yuval Steinitz, second left, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, center, and Minister of Justice Tzipi Livni at Netanyahu's office on May 23, 2013, in Jerusalem.

Uriel Sinai/UPI /Landov Update at 5:14 p.m. ET, Yaalon Apologizes Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon apologized late Tuesday for comments in which he described U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry as having a \"messianic fervor\" toward bringing peace to the Mideast. \"The defense minister did not intend to insult the secretary and he apologizes if the secretary was hurt by the remarks attributed to the defense minister,\" a statement issued by Yaalon's office. Israel's Haaretz newspaper reported: \"The apology was issued [after] a two-hour meeting between Ya'alon and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the premier's residence in Jerusalem. The statement, which was composed together with Netanyahu, followed a lukewarm response from Ya'alon earlier in the day which was rejected by the Obama Administration. \"Senior American officials said prior to the release of the statement that the United States was not satisfied with the Israeli government's response to Ya'alon's remarks and expected Netanyahu to issue a public condemnation.\" Our original post continues below: U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has said he's encouraged by talks with Israel and the Palestinians despite widespread criticism and skepticism, but comments Tuesday reportedly by an important Israeli interlocutor in those talks show just how difficult discussions are over a possible peace deal. Yedioth Ahronoth, Israel's most widely circulated newspaper, quoted Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon as saying: \"In reality, there have been no negotiations between us and the Palestinians for all these months \u2013 but rather between us and the Americans. \"The only thing that can 'save us' is for John Kerry to win a Nobel Prize and leave us in peace.\" The newspaper said the comments were made both in private conversations in Israel and in the U.S. It did not provide a date for the alleged remarks. Here are more of Yaalon's reported comments: \"The American security plan presented to us is not worth the paper it's written on. It contains no peace and no security. Only our continued presence in Judea and Samaria and the River Jordan will ensure that Ben-Gurion Airport and Netanya don't become targets for rockets from every direction. American Secretary of State John Kerry, who turned up here determined and acting out of misplaced obsession and messianic fervor, cannot teach me anything about the conflict with the Palestinians.\" Judea and Samaria are the biblical names for the West Bank. Criticism of Kerry's efforts aren't unusual, but these remarks were made by the man who, in the words of Yedioth Ahronoth, \"sits beside Netanyahu during the talks with Kerry.\" The U.S. State Department criticized the comments. \"The remarks of the Defense Minister if accurate are offensive and inappropriate especially given all that the United States is doing to support Israel's security needs,\" spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement. \"Secretary Kerry and his team including General [John ] Allen have been working day and night to try to promote a secure peace for Israel because of the Secretary's deep concern for Israel's future. To question his motives and distort his proposals is not something we would expect from the Defense Minister of a close ally.\" Israel's Haaretz newspaper reported that several Israeli officials also criticized the remarks. Yaalon hasn't denied that he made the comments, but he told students in southern Israel on Tuesday that \"even if there are differences and friction within various discussions, and there are, they must not affect the interests or common goals of Israel and the United States.\" Haaretz reported that Yaalon, in a clarification published Tuesday, said: \"When there are differences we iron them out inside the room, including with Secretary of State Kerry, with whom I hold many talks concerning the future of Israel.\" He added: \"The U.S. is our greatest friend and our most important ally; I will keep safeguarding the security of the citizens of Israel resolutely, responsibly and with discretion.\" Kerry is expected back in the region presently to deliver a \"framework\" for a future peace deal. The Associated Press reports: \"The sides have set an April target date for agreeing upon a framework for peace. But in recent weeks, they appear to have hardened their positions. \"The Palestinians seek the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip, territories captured by Israel in 1967, for an independent state. \"Netanyahu wants to keep parts of the West Bank and says he will not share control of east Jerusalem, home to sensitive religious sites. He has also insisted that the Palestinians recognize Israel as the Jewish homeland, a condition they say would undermine the rights of Palestinian refugees and Israel's own Arab minority.\"", "title": "Israeli Minister: Kerry Should 'Win A Nobel Prize And Leave Us In Peace'", "_id": 46669617, "tags": null, "source": "http://www.npr.org/rss/rss.php?id=1004", "updated": "Tue, 14 Jan 2014 12:46:00 -0500", "html": "<html><body><div><div id=\"storytext\" class=\"storytext storylocation linkLocation\">\n      <div id=\"res262471449\" class=\"bucketwrap image medium\" previewtitle=\"U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, second right, stands with Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, left, Minister of International Relations Yuval Steinitz, second left, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, center, and Minister of Justice Tzipi Livni at Netanyahu's office on May 23, 2013, in Jerusalem.\">\n            \n      \n\n      <div class=\"captionwrap\">\n                  <div class=\"caption\">\n                        <p><b class=\"hide-caption\"><b>hide caption</b></b>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, second right, stands with Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, left, Minister of International Relations Yuval Steinitz, second left, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, center, and Minister of Justice Tzipi Livni at Netanyahu's office on May 23, 2013, in Jerusalem.</p>\n         </div>\n         \n\n      </div>\n      \n\n      <span class=\"creditwrap\"><span class=\"credit\">Uriel Sinai</span>/<span class=\"rightsnotice\">UPI /Landov</span></span>      <div class=\"enlarge_measure\">\n                  <div class=\"img_wrap\">\n                        <img data-original=\"http://media.npr.org/assets/img/2014/01/14/16825201_h22468097-56d501553e9266c3f7abe8f57a40abc9d95401e3-s40.jpg\" title=\"U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, second right, stands with Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, left, Minister of International Relations Yuval Steinitz, second left, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, center, and Minister of Justice Tzipi Livni at Netanyahu's office on May 23, 2013, in Jerusalem.\" alt=\"U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, second right, stands with Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, left, Minister of International Relations Yuval Steinitz, second left, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, center, and Minister of Justice Tzipi Livni at Netanyahu's office on May 23, 2013, in Jerusalem.\"/>\n         </div>\n         \n\n      </div>\n      \n\n      <div class=\"enlarge_html\">\n                  <div class=\"image_data\">\n                        <p class=\"caption\">U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, second right, stands with Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, left, Minister of International Relations Yuval Steinitz, second left, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, center, and Minister of Justice Tzipi Livni at Netanyahu's office on May 23, 2013, in Jerusalem.</p>             <span class=\"creditwrap\"><span class=\"credit\">Uriel Sinai</span>/<span class=\"rightsnotice\">UPI /Landov</span></span>\n         </div>\n         \n\n      </div>\n      \n\n   </div>\n   <p><strong>Update at 5:14 p.m. ET, Yaalon Apologizes</strong></p>   <p>Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon apologized late Tuesday for comments in which he described U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry as having a \"messianic fervor\" toward bringing peace to the Mideast.</p>   <p>\"The defense minister did not intend to insult the secretary and he apologizes if the secretary was hurt by the remarks attributed to the defense minister,\" a statement issued by Yaalon's office.</p>   <p><a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.568666\" target=\"_blank\">Israel's <em>Haaretz</em> newspaper reported</a>:</p>   <blockquote class=\"edTag\"><div>   <p>\"The apology was issued [after] a two-hour meeting between Ya'alon and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the premier's residence in Jerusalem.

It was followed by a second blast as coinciding emergency services entered, police officer Mohamed Warsame said. \"Another car loaded with explosives went off as security forces were trying to assist victims,\" police officer Mohamed Warsame said.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. The Jazeera hotel, near the international airport, is one of the seaside capital's most upmarket and its clientele includes Somali politicians and visiting foreign officials. The attacks on one of the securest places in Mogadishu underscore the security challenges facing President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, whose election by lawmakers last year was hailed by many as a way to end two decades of conflict. 340", "title": "Al-Shabab claims Somali hotel bombings", "_id": 51319985, "tags": null, "source": "http://www.aljazeera.com/Services/Rss/?PostingId=2007721151816881407", "updated": "Thu, 02 Jan 2014 12:21:45 GMT", "html": "<html><body><div><td id=\"ctl00_cphBody_tdTextContent\" class=\"DetailedSummary\">&#13;\n            &#13;\n                <p>Somali rebel group, al-Shabab, has claimed responsibility for two car bombs that left at least 11 people dead near the heavily-guarded international airport in the Somali capital.</p>&#13;\n<p>\"al-Shabab Mujahideen takes full responsibility for last night's attack that targeted a meeting of senior apostate intelligence officials in Mogadishu,\" \u00a0Sheikh Ali Dheera said on Thursday.</p>&#13;\n<p>\"Apostates will have no safe haven in Somalia.\" he added.</p>&#13;\n<p>The first attack happened when a car bomb rammed into one of Mogadishu's top hotels near a UN compound in Mogadishu on Wednesday.</p>&#13;\n<p>It was followed by a second blast as coinciding emergency services entered, police officer Mohamed Warsame said.</p>&#13;\n<p>\"Another car loaded with explosives went off as security forces were trying to assist victims,\" police officer Mohamed Warsame said.</p>&#13;\n<p>The first two bombs came in quick succession and were followed by heavy bursts of gunfire by Somali security forces.</p>&#13;\n<p>The third blast took place about an hour later when a bomb went off inside a car that was being searched by the military.</p>&#13;\n<p><strong>Suicide attack</strong></p>&#13;\n<p>\"A booby-trapped car exploded against Hotel Jazeera,\" said\u00a0\u00a0Muhidin Ahmed, a police officer, referring to the first blast, adding that it caused an unspecified number of deaths.</p>&#13;\n<p>\"It appears to be a suicide attack.\"</p>&#13;\n<p>Witnesses reported an intense exchange of gunfire between assailants and security officers.

And even a new tax on cigarettes doesn't seem to be deterring Greek smokers. Joanna Kakissis has the story from Athens. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) JOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: Antigoni Papaconstantinou started smoking two years ago when she 19. ANTIGONI PAPACONSTANTINOU: (Foreign language spoken) KAKISSIS: I was working at a bar, she said, and everyone smoked. PAPACONSTANTINOU: (Foreign language spoken) KAKISSIS: Antigoni explains that you practically can't go out in Greece unless you smoke. Going out for a drink also means going out for a cigarette. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KAKISSIS: I met Antigoni at Booze Cooperative, a cafe-bar and art space in central Athens. Young hipsters play chess as they puff on cigarettes. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KAKISSIS: The grey-haired owner, Nikos Louvros, smokes five packs a day. (Foreign language spoken) NIKOS LOUVROS: (Foreign language spoken) KAKISSIS: I ask Louvros if he's worried about his health. I'm almost 59-years-old, and I've never had to go the hospital, he says. I take an aspirin a day, and I'm just fine. The smoking he allows at his bar is a violation of the country's ban, but he's never had to pay a fine. He circumvented it by starting a pro-smoking political party. LOUVROS: (Foreign language spoken) KAKISSIS: This bar is party headquarters, he says, so the constitution protects us. (SOUNDBITE OF CHATTER) KAKISSIS: A few blocks away, there is a place that welcomes the smoking ban. It's Avocado, a vegetarian bistro that offers meditation classes. One of the owners is a glowing yogi named Vivi Letsou. VIVI LETSOU: Word is out that this is a strictly non-smoking place. They can smoke outside in our tables on the sidewalk. They wish that we had more tables and chairs outside to accommodate the smokers. (SOUNDBITE OF LIGHTER FLICKING) KAKISSIS: Outside, Anastasios Papapavlous, a businessman in his 50s, is lighting a cigar after dinner. ANASTASIOS PAPAPAVLOUS: (Foreign language spoken) KAKISSIS: The ancient Greeks used to say that moderation is best, he says. I smoke cigars occasionally but I don't want the smoke to bother anyone. (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC) KAKISSIS: Back at the Booze Cooperative, Antigoni Papaconstantinou and two young friends talk about quitting - or at least smoking less. PAPACONSTANTINOU: (Foreign language spoken) KAKISSIS: Anastasia Malikovska, who works on yachts, says her father was a heavy smoker for years and only quit when he thought he had cancer. And yet, she says, she's still smoking. Despite the health warnings, the ban, even the tax, Greeks are still struggling with a habit that many here say is part of the culture.

The previous trials resulted in a conviction, overturned on appeal, and a mistrial. A man charged with killing nine people, including six monks, at a suburban Phoenix Buddhist temple in 1991 carefully planned the slayings and didn't miss a shot as he fired 17 rounds into the victims, most to the back of their heads, a prosecutor told jurors in closing arguments Monday.

Doody.Doody was 17 when he was accused of participating in the slayings at the Wat Promkunaram temple. He was found guilty in 1993 and sentenced to 281 years in prison. But an appeals court threw out his conviction in 2011 after ruling that investigators improperly obtained his confession.His second trial ended in October with a mistrial after jurors failed to reach a verdict.Doody's third trial began Dec. 4. He has maintained his innocence.Jurors deliberated briefly Monday afternoon before adjourning for the day. Deliberations resume Tuesday morning.During closing arguments, prosecutor Jason Kalish told jurors that Doody calculated the attack precisely and was determined to leave behind no witnesses who could identify him.Doody's brother and mother were members of the temple, but neither was there the night of the shootings.\"This was someone who planned out what was going to happen before he even stepped foot inside thattemple,\" Kalish told jurors. \"This is somebody going person to person and back again killing them, shooting them, making sure they were dead.\"Allesandro \"Alex\" Garcia pleaded guilty in the case and was sentenced to life in prison in exchange for his testimony and a promise that prosecutors wouldn't seek the death penalty.During the retrials, Garcia described for jurors how the crime was Doody's idea, aimed at stealing about $2,600 cash and valuables from the monks.Police eventually found the stolen items at Garcia's house, where Doody was staying at the time.Defense attorneys say Garcia is lying and only implicated Doody to avoid a death sentence, pointing out for jurors how he initially implicated four other men from Tucson who were later found to have had nothing to do with the killings.Authorities \"were under a lot of pressure to solve these crimes,\" defense attorney Maria Schaffer told jurors Monday. \"The world was shocked by what happened with the murder of the monks.\"She called Garcia a cunning manipulator, noting that without his testimony, \"the state would not have a case against my client.\"\"The only killer, the only murderer that has been in this courtroom is Alex Garcia,\" Schaffer said. \"And Mr. Doody isn't guilty, was not involved in the temple murders whatsoever.\"Prosecutors say both men are equally culpable.In his confession, Doody said he went to the temple with Garcia but claimed he was outside when the shootings occurred. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling meant prosecutors couldn't use Doody's confession at his retrials. They instead relied largely on Garcia's testimony.Doody was spared the death penalty in his first trial.Prosecutors couldn't seek the death penalty in Doody's retrials because of a 2005 US Supreme Court decision that prohibits authorities from pursuing that punishment against defendants who were younger than 18 years old when the crime occurred.

But it has been scarred by a long and bitter civil war arising out of ethnic tensions between the majority Sinhalese and the Tamil minority in the northeast. After more than 25 years of violence the conflict ended in May 2009, when government forces seized the last area controlled by Tamil Tiger rebels. But recriminations over abuses by both sides continue. The island fell under Portuguese and Dutch influence after the 16th century, and Britain began its conquest in the 1790s. Historic Kandy is home to the Temple of the Tooth Relic, one of Sri Lankan Buddhism's most revered sites There was a long-established Tamil minority in the north and east, and Britain also brought in Tamil labourers to work the coffee and tea plantations in the central highlands. This made the island, then called Ceylon, a major tea producer. The majority Buddhist Sinhalese resented what they saw as British favouritism towards the mainly-Hindu Tamils. The growth of assertive Sinhala nationalism after independence fanned the flames of ethnic division, and civil war erupted in the 1980s against Tamils pressing for self-rule. Continue reading the main story NATION AT WAR Army and Tamil separatists fought a long conflict involving air raids, roadside blasts, suicide bombings, land and sea battles Between 80,000 and 100,000 estimated killed 1983 - Start of war 2009 - Government forces re-conquer all rebel-held territory Most of the fighting took place in the north. But the conflict also penetrated the heart of Sri Lankan society, with Tamil Tiger rebels carrying out devastating suicide bombings in the capital Colombo in the 1990s. The violence killed more than 70,000 people, damaged the economy and harmed tourism in one of South Asia's potentially most prosperous societies. International concern was raised about the fate of civilians caught up in the conflict zone during the final stages of the war, the confinement of some 250,000 Tamil refugees to camps for months afterwards, and allegations that the government had ordered the execution of captured or surrendering rebels. A UN report published in 2011 said both sides in the conflict committed war crimes against civilians. The Sri Lankan government rejected this and later reports as biased. In September 2013 the main Tamil opposition party won a convincing victory in elections to a devolved provincial council in the north, which was set up after constitutional talks with the government.

The two teams\u2019 paths to the title game could hardly be more different. While Auburn rode an improbable streak of miracle plays and close finishes to Pasadena, Florida State\u2019s fans scarcely remembered what suspense felt like (before Monday, anyway).

The SEC has dominated the BCS landscape for the better part of a decade, with the the national championship representative \u2013 Auburn, or Alabama, or Florida, or LSU\u2013 routinely scraping through a gauntlet of tough conference match ups to reach the national title game and promptly embarrass the non-SEC team (Oregon, Notre Dame, etc.) For much of the first half Monday night, that cycle looked to be repeating itself. The Seminoles, who cruised through the ACC and had a average 42-point margin of victory over their opponents, looked hurried and confused at the hands of a swarming Auburn defense. Heisman-winning quarterback Jameis Winston spent most of 2013 nestled behind a brick wall of an offensive line, throwing to an all-star cast of gargantuan wide receivers with little disturbance.

Moments later, a group of youths, black and white, marched by her, chanting, \u201cMandela, yo. Mandela, yo.\u201d Mapengeza began chanting, too.The four-hour service was filled with emotional tributes and joyous song. The rich crowded with the poor, children with the elderly, all to remember Mandela, who died Thursday at age 95.\u201cOnly Mandela can bring together people of different races, cultures, even religions,\u201d said Nkuli Simelane, 30, a tour guide. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want blacks to be on one side and the rich on one side. He wanted everyone to be together.\u201dGen. Thanduxolo Mandela, a family member, echoed those sentiments in his eulogy. \u201cIn his lifetime, Madiba mingled with kings, queens and presidents. At the core, he was a man of the people. A simple man,\u201d said the general, referring to Mandela by his Xhosa clan name. \u201cI am sure Madiba is smiling from above as he looks down at the multitude of diversity gathered here, for this is what he strove for \u2014 the equality of man, the brotherhood of humanity.\u201d [See which heads of state attended.] Many in the stadium carried umbrellas and South African flags, or were draped in the green, yellow and black colors of the ruling African National Congress. Some blew plastic horns known as vuvuzelas. Others unfurled large banners bearing Mandela\u2019s face. Two giant television screens alternated between showing images of Mandela and the dancing crowds.Although the voices of the crowd seemed to fill the stadium, many of the uncovered seating areas remained empty, perhaps because of the downpour. The covered sections were filled. Tuesday\u2019s ceremony included prayers by leaders of several faiths and remarks by four of Mandela\u2019s 18 grandchildren.\u201cYou have lived a beautiful life. You bequeathed us a better world than the one you were born in,\u201d Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, chair of the African Union Commission, said in her eulogy. \u201cWe thank you for having mentored us.\u201d A gathering of leaders More than 90 heads of state and governments attended the ceremony at the First National Bank Stadium, more than those who attended the 2005 funeral of Pope John Paul II. The list of dignitaries included former U.S. presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. Many African leaders also came. Other leaders arrived from as far away as Afghanistan, Australia and Scandinavia. Scores of police were stationed outside and inside, inspecting bags and keeping watch.Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, one of several world leaders who gave eulogies, called Mandela a \u201csource of inspiration\u201d for freedom struggles in Brazil and throughout South America. \u201cHis fight reached way beyond his nation's border and inspired young men and women to fight for independence and social justice,\u201d Rousseff said through an interpreter. [Read: By shaking Castro\u2019s hand, Obama avoids awkward slight.] The stadium is where Mandela was last seen in public, during soccer\u2019s World Cup competition in 2010. It was a fitting place to say farewell, not only because of its size but the symbolism of its location, in Soweto. The former segregated township was at the center of the anti-apartheid protests in the 1970s and 1980s. Mandela, who owned a house in Soweto, became South Africa\u2019s first black president in 1994, after the nation\u2019s first multi-racial elections.Leonard Teboho, 32, whose T-shirt was emblazoned with Mandela's face and the slogan \u201cfather of the nation,\u201d said his mother received a house from the government when Mandela was president. It was the first home the family had ever owned. And although he is unemployed at the moment, Teboho said he had come to thank Mandela for a better life. \u201cWe are here not to mourn but to celebrate his life,\u201d he said. Francois Pienaar, the captain of the South African rugby team that won the 1995 World Cup, described the ceremony as \u201cvery emotional, very happy, very sad, painful and reflective.\u201d\u201cTo see all these people come out to say farewell is very special,\u201d said Pienaar, who worked closely with Mandela to use the World Cup victory to reconcile a nation divided by its past. He said that he last saw Mandela three years ago and that he will always remember the leader\u2019s broad smile. \u201cIt was a beautiful smile. He was so genuine,\u201d Pienaar said. \u201cHe was a real person.\u201d \u2018A motivation for our kids\u2019 After Tuesday\u2019s ceremony, Mandela\u2019s body will lie in state for three days in the Union Buildings in the capital, Pretoria, once the epicenter of white rule. On Sunday, he will be buried in his ancestral village of Qunu, in the Eastern Cape.Other stadiums in the Johannesburg area were equipped with giant screens to accommodate people who could not get to the stadium where the ceremony was taking place. At one, Ellis Park Stadium, only a few people gathered, perhaps because of the wet weather.On Tuesday, both the powerful and the ordinary expressed hope that Mandela\u2019s legacy will live on.\u201cHe was a motivation for our kids,\u201d said Rosinal Kawana, who works at a supermarket.And said Obama: \u201cWe will never see the likes of Nelson Mandela again. But let me say to the young people of Africa, and young people around the world: You can make his life\u2019s work your own.\u201dBy 4:30 p.m., everyone had exited through the same gates of the stadium \u2014 the rich and powerful to their shiny black cars, the rest to buses and trains \u2014 and returned to their separate lives.

Scores of police were stationed outside and inside, inspecting bags and keeping watch.</p><p>Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, one of several world leaders who gave eulogies, called Mandela a \u201csource of inspiration\u201d for freedom struggles in Brazil and throughout South America. \u201cHis fight reached way beyond his nation's border and inspired young men and women to fight for independence and social justice,\u201d Rousseff said through an interpreter.</p><p>\n\n<a data-xslt=\"_http\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/12/10/obama-greets-leaders-including-raul-castro-at-mandela-memorial/\">[Read: By shaking Castro\u2019s hand, Obama avoids awkward slight.]</a>\n<em>\n<a data-xslt=\"_http\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2013/12/10/obama-greets-leaders-including-raul-castro-at-mandela-memorial/\">\n</a>\n</em>\n\n</p><p>The stadium is where Mandela was last seen in public, during soccer\u2019s World Cup competition in 2010. It was a fitting place to say farewell, not only because of its size but the symbolism of its location, in Soweto. The former segregated township was at the center of the anti-apartheid protests in the 1970s and 1980s. Mandela, who owned a house in Soweto, became South Africa\u2019s first black president in 1994, after the nation\u2019s first multi-racial elections.</p><p>Leonard Teboho, 32, whose <br/>T-shirt was emblazoned with Mandela's face and the slogan  \u201cfather of the nation,\u201d said his mother received a house from the government when Mandela was president. It was the first home the family had ever owned. And although he is  unemployed at the moment, Teboho said he had come to thank Mandela for a better life. \u201cWe are here not to mourn but to celebrate his life,\u201d he said. </p><p>Francois Pienaar, the captain of the South African rugby team that won the 1995 World Cup, described the ceremony as \u201cvery emotional, very happy, very sad, painful and reflective.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTo see all these people come out to say farewell is very special,\u201d said Pienaar, who worked closely with Mandela to use the World Cup victory to reconcile a nation divided by its past. He said that he last saw Mandela three years ago and that he will always remember the leader\u2019s broad smile. </p><p>\u201cIt was a beautiful smile. He was so genuine,\u201d Pienaar said. \u201cHe was a real person.\u201d</p><p>\n<strong>\u2018A motivation for our kids\u2019</strong>\n</p><p>After Tuesday\u2019s ceremony, Mandela\u2019s body will lie in state for three days in the Union Buildings in the capital, Pretoria, once the epicenter of white rule. On Sunday, he will be buried in his ancestral village of Qunu, in the Eastern Cape.</p><p>Other stadiums in the Johannesburg area were equipped with giant screens to accommodate people who could not get to the stadium where the ceremony was taking place. At one, Ellis Park Stadium, only a few people gathered, perhaps because of the wet weather.</p><p>On Tuesday, both the powerful and the ordinary expressed hope that Mandela\u2019s legacy will live on.</p><p>\u201cHe was a motivation for our kids,\u201d said Rosinal Kawana, who works at a supermarket.</p><p>And said Obama: \u201cWe will never see the likes of Nelson Mandela again. But let me say to the young people of Africa, and young people around the world: You can make his life\u2019s work your own.\u201d</p><p>By 4:30 p.m., everyone had exited through the same gates of the stadium \u2014 the rich and powerful to their shiny black cars, the rest to buses and trains \u2014 and returned to their separate lives. </p><p>\n<strong>\n\n</strong>\n</p><p>\n<em>Steven Mufson in Johannesburg and Debbi Wilgoren in Washington contributed to this report.</em>\n</p></article>&#13;\n\t\t\t\t</div></body></html>", "author": "Sudarsan Raghavan", "published": "Tue, 10 Dec 2013 22:51:00 GMT"}, {"url": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636635/s/35cf980d/sc/1/l/0L0Swashingtonpost0N0Cbusiness0Ceconomy0Cdc0Earea0Ebankruptcy0Efilings0Efor0Ejan0E130C20A140C0A10C110Cb9fb0A0Ac20E786b0E11e30Eb1c50E739e63e9c9a70Istory0Bhtml0Dwprss0Frss0Inational/story01.htm", "text": "In a Chapter 7 liquidation, a court trustee sells assets to pay creditors\u2019 claims.

EU candidacy is frozen amid a dispute with Greece over use of the name Macedonia Country profiles compiled by BBC Monitoring In August 2004, parliament approved legislation redrawing local boundaries and giving ethnic Albanians greater local autonomy in areas where they predominate. Recognition of the republic's progress from the brink of civil war came in December 2005 when the EU leaders agreed that it should become a candidate for membership. The EU has urged Macedonia to crack down on corruption ahead of accession talks. An important milestone on the country's path to EU membership was reached towards the end of 2009, when Macedonian citizens were granted the right to visa-free travel within the Schengen zone. Name game The country's name remains a contentious issue. It is still referred to as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) at the United Nations. International recognition of the country's split from Yugoslavia in 1991 was held up over Greek fears that its name implied territorial ambitions toward the northern Greek region of Macedonia. Greece lifted a two-year trade blockade only after the two countries signed an accord in 1995. In 2008, Nato leaders agreed to invite Albania and Croatia to join the alliance. But Greece blocked Macedonia's invitation because of the dispute over the country's name. In December 2008, Macedonia decided to take the issue of its name to the International Court of Justice in the Hague. Three years later, the ICJ ruled that Greece had been wrong to block Macedonia's Nato bid because of the row of the country's name. The decision was a significant diplomatic victory for Macedonia, although it did not address the dispute over the name. And although Macedonia was confirmed as an EU candidate country in December 2005, the name issue continues to hamper its progress towards full EU membership.

Skip to next paragraph Subscribe Today to the Monitor Click Here for your FREE 30 DAYS ofThe Christian Science MonitorWeekly Digital Edition The New York-based Satanic Temple says Oklahoma's decision to put a Ten Commandments monument at the capitol opens the door for the statue of Satan. The New York-based Satanic Temple formally submitted its application to a panel that oversees the Capitol grounds, including an artist's rendering that depicts Satan as Baphomet, a goat-headed figure with horns, wings and a long beard that's often used as a symbol of the occult. In the rendering, Satan is sitting in a pentagram-adorned throne with smiling children next to him.\"The monument has been designed to reflect the views of Satanists in Oklahoma City and beyond,\" temple spokesman Lucien Greaves said in a statement. \"The statue will also have a functional purpose as a chair where people of all ages may sit on the lap of Satan for inspiration and contemplation.\" The Satanic Temple maintains that the Oklahoma Legislature's decision to authorize a privately funded Ten Commandments monument at the Capitol opened the door for its statue. The Ten Commandments monument was placed on the north steps of the building in 2012, and the Oklahoma chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has sued to have it removed.Similar requests for monuments have been made by a Hindu leader in Nevada, an animal rights group and the satirical Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.In response, the Oklahoma Capitol Preservation Commission recently placed a moratorium on considering any new requests.\"Anybody can still make their request, but we'll hold off on considering them until the lawsuit is adjudicated,\" commission Chairman Trait Thompson said.The push by the Satanic Temple has rankled elected leaders in this conservative state known as the buckle of the Bible Belt, who say such a proposal would never be approved by the commission.\"I think you've got to remember where you are. This is Oklahoma, the middle of the heartland,\" said Rep. Don Armes, R-Faxon. \"I think we need to be tolerant of people who think different than us, but this is Oklahoma, and that's not going to fly here.\"While Greaves acknowledges the Satanic Temple's effort is in part to highlight what it says is hypocrisy of state leaders in Oklahoma, he says the group is serious about having a monument placed there.The group already has raised nearly half of the $20,000 it says it needs to build the monument.\"We plan on moving forward one way or another,\" Greaves said.Another Oklahoma legislator, Rep. Earl Sears, called the group's effort \"an insult to the good people of the state.\"\"I do not see Satanism as a religion, and they have no place at the state Capitol,\" said Sears, R-Bartlesville. On its website, the Satanic Temple explains that it \"seeks to separate Religion from Superstition by acknowledging religious belief as a metaphorical framework with which we construct a narrative context for our goals and works.\"Satan stands as the ultimate icon for the selfless revolt against tyranny, free rational inquiry, and the responsible pursuit of happiness,\" the website says.", "title": "Satan statue design for Oklahoma state capital unveiled (+video)", "_id": 80877417, "tags": null, "source": "http://rss.csmonitor.com/feeds/usa", "updated": "", "html": "<html><body><div><p>Satan statue design for the Sooner State's capital building grounds was presented Monday.

Curtis Reeves, the retired police captain who allegedly shot and killed a man who threw popcorn at him at a showing of \u201cLone Survivor\u201d near Tampa on Monday, will remain in jail after a judge denied a bond request Tuesday. Skip to next paragraph Subscribe Today to the Monitor Click Here for your FREE 30 DAYS ofThe Christian Science MonitorWeekly Digital Edition Mr. Reeves was charged with second-degree murder after Pasco County, Fla., law enforcement officials considered and rejected the notion that the shooting of 43-year-old Chad Oulson inside the Wesley Chapel, Fla., movieplex was justified under the state\u2019s hotly-debated \u201cstand your ground\u201d law, which allows armed people to shoot and kill someone in self-defense at the first hint of serious danger. In denying Reeves bond, Judge Lynn Tepper rejected defense assertions that the second-degree murder charge was excessive. \u201cThe evidence of guilt is significant,\u201d she said.Despite the quickly filed murder charge, however, there\u2019s a building debate in Florida about whether Reeves may be able to legally claim that he was justified in shooting Mr. Oulson, given both Reeves\u2019 advanced age and his training as a police officer.\u201cElderly people are a little bit more vulnerable than regular adults, so what may give a younger person a black eye could mean a cracked skull for a septuagenarian \u2013 that\u2019s certainly a factor that may be figured in,\u201d says Bob Dekle, a former Florida prosecutor who\u2019s now a legal skills lecturer at the University of Florida\u2019s Levin College of Law in Gainesville.\u201cIt\u2019s also important to remember that probable cause [to arrest] is not a very high standard, it\u2019s just right above suspicion, and the fact that the judge endorsed the officer\u2019s \u2026 probable cause to arrest and then denied a bond, that\u2019s pretty well standard.\u201dAfter Reeves confronted Oulson about his use of a cell phone to send text messages during the movie previews, an argument escalated quickly. Witnesses say that when the younger Oulson threw a bag of popcorn at Reeves, the elder man grabbed his .380 semi-automatic pistol out of a pants pocket and fired. He told police later that he was \u201cin fear of being attacked.\u201dIt\u2019s legal in Florida to have a concealed gun in a movie theater, and retired police officers don\u2019t need a special license to carry a gun as long as their certification is current.To be sure, the mixture of texting, popcorn, and guns that led to Oulson\u2019s death is being seen by some as a poignant commentary on shifting social expectations in public places, in the wake of liberalized gun laws that have turned America into \u201cvirtually a fully armed society,\u201d as George Washington University law professor Bob Cottrol told the Monitor recently.Legal experts point to the denial of bond and the police weighing of \u201cstand your ground\u201d before charging Reeves with murder as evidence that it will be difficult for him to argue self-defense.Nevertheless, Reeves\u2019 statements to police have at least hinted at a possibility that he could utilize the same law that became famous in the wake of George Zimmerman\u2019s shooting of Trayvon Martin in 2012.\u201cThe defendant advised that he got into an argument with the victim over phone usage,\" the police report from Pasco County Sheriff's office said. \"The defendant advised that the victim turned and stood up striking him in the face with an unknown object.\"Pasco Sheriff Chris Nocco said Tuesday that his office considered self-defense and rejected it out of hand as it applies to this shooting.\"I can tell you we wanted to make sure that [the \u2018stand your ground\u2019] defense was taken off the table,\" Nocco told the Tampa Bay Times.Nevertheless, some legal experts say Reeves may be able to convince a judge and jury otherwise, but only if he can make them believe that he reasonably feared for his life before firing.\"Don't be quick to condemn\" Reeves\u2019 response to the popcorn attack, wrote Plant City defense attorney Ronald Tulin on his Facebook page. He noted that Florida law allows deadly self-defense in order to \u201cprevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony.

No reporters were present to witness Khodorkovsky\u2019s departure from a penal colony in northwest Russia that was once part of the network of gulags the Soviets installed close to the Arctic Circle. Russia\u2019s penitentiary service said Khodorkovsky was on his way to Berlin, where his mother was undergoing medical treatment. But there was some confusion after Russian reporters discovered that Marina Khodorkovsky was still in Moscow and had received no news from her son.Later in the day, the German Foreign Ministry confirmed that he had landed at Berlin\u2019s Sch\u00f6ne\u00adfeld Airport, where he was greeted by a ministry representative. Der Spiegel reported that Khodorkovsky had been met by the former German foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who had helped organize the charter flight. Despite all the muddle, it appears that plans to release Khodorkovsky had been in the works for some time. In a statement late Friday, Khodorkovsky said he had appealed to Putin for a pardon for \u201cfamily reasons\u201d on Nov. 12. But his former business partner Platon Lebedev, who has also been in jail for 10 years, chose the same moment to issue a statement through his lawyers saying he would not be seeking a pardon for now.In a chilling tale, the Kommersant business daily reported that Russian secret service officers had visited Khodorkovsky in jail some weeks ago to outline his bleak prospects. No lawyers were present at the meeting.Khodorkovsky was hoping to be released next year in August when his two concurrent sentences expire. However, his visitors bore alarming news that state prosecutors were preparing a third case that could keep him in jail for several more years. The deteriorating health of Khodorkovsky\u2019s mother was also discussed. Although unconfirmed, the Kommersant report suggests that Khodorkovsky came under pressure to strike a deal with authorities to secure his release. If that was the case, it appears that the parties had not agreed on a crucial detail. Khodorkovsky stressed in his statement that while appealing to Putin for a pardon he had not confessed his guilt. That assertion contradicted earlier statements by several Russian officials that a request for a pardon was tantamount to an admission of wrongdoing. \u201cHis amnesty request to the president has been submitted. If he is asking to be pardoned, this means he is admitting guilt,\u201d Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Putin, told the Interfax news agency on Thursday.After Khodorkovsky was arrested in 2003, his Yukos oil corporation came under sustained attack from Russian tax collectors and was eventually sold off at bankruptcy auctions. The state oil company, Rosneft, scooped up most of Yukos\u2019s best assets at the sales. Khodorkovsky was forced to give up his Yukos holdings, but other groups of shareholders are suing the Russian government and Rosneft in international courts for billions of dollars for expropriating their assets. The powerful president of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, said Friday that Khodorkovsky\u2019s appeal for a pardon improved the \u201clegal grounds\u201d to protect Rosneft\u2019s interests in the Yukos case, although it was not clear how this might come about. Sechin also offered a somewhat implausible solution to the problem of what Khodorkovsky might do next, saying he would consider him for a job at Rosneft if an appropriate position came up. Lyudmila Alexeyeva, the head of the Moscow Helsinki Group \u2014 Russia\u2019s oldest human rights organization \u2014 saw a different outcome: Khodorkovsky would become a much needed \u201cspiritual leader\u201d in Russia, filling a role similar to those played by Mohandas K. Gandhi in India and Vaclav Havel in the Czech Republic. \u201cHe will become one of us. I am sure we will cooperate. I am ready to do everything I can to help him,\u201d she said.", "title": "Khodorkovsky walks free, but his plans remain a mystery", "_id": 84548437, "tags": null, "source": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/rss/world/europe", "updated": "Sat, 21 Dec 2013 01:36:00 GMT", "html": "<html><body><div><article>&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Khodorkovsky, who was jailed in 2003 on charges of tax evasion and fraud that his supporters say were politically motivated, had served a long term and his mother was ill, the Russian president said.</p><p>True to his word, Putin inked a decree Friday pardoning Khodorkovsky and ordering the immediate release of one of the president\u2019s most vocal critics. </p><p>No reporters were present to witness Khodorkovsky\u2019s departure from a penal colony in northwest Russia that was once part of the network of gulags the Soviets installed close to the Arctic Circle. </p><p>Russia\u2019s penitentiary service said Khodorkovsky was on his way to Berlin, where his mother was undergoing medical treatment.

In Russia, where the courts regularly take orders directly from political authorities, the case was widely seen as a warning from Putin. He would tolerate no challenge, and anyone who dared to defy him could expect to share the fate of Khodorkovsky, who had angered Putin by financing political opposition to him.After a news conference Thursday, Putin told reporters that he planned to sign an order pardoning Khodorkovsky \u201cin the nearest time.\u201d Khodorkovsky has served 10 years in jail and was due out in August. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious term,\u201d Putin said. Even as the amnesty was being prepared, it appeared that Khodorkovsky would not be included. He has faced two trials. The first, in which he was found guilty of tax evasion and fraud in 2005, was followed by a trial in 2010 in which he was accused of stealing all of the oil produced at Yukos during the years he served as head of the company. Khodorkovsky has consistently denied those charges.Over the past few weeks, senior Russian lawmakers have indicated that a fresh case was being prepared against Khodorkovsky that could preclude his release in 2014.However, before announcing plans to pardon Khodorkovsky on Thursday, Putin said a third case against the prisoner was unlikely to materialize. \u201cI do not understand at all where the case is. I have heard that they talk about it, but for now I do not see any threats for anyone there,\u201d Putin said at the news conference. Explaining the decision to release Khodorkovsky, Putin said the jailed tycoon had written a letter appealing for clemency, saying that his mother was ill. However, Vadim Klyuvgant, an attorney for Khodorkovsky, was unable to confirm that his client had asked for a pardon. \u201cWe don\u2019t have this information, although we\u2019ve received a number of pardon appeals on his behalf from other people over the years,\u201d he said. According to the Russian constitution, the president has the power to pardon prisoners without first receiving an appeal for clemency, Klyuvgant told the Russian radio station Ekho Moskvy. Khodorkovsky\u2019s mother, Marina Khodorkovsky, said she had not seen her son since July and had received no information that he planned to appeal for clemency. \u201cHe needs to be released \u2014 his children and even grandchildren grew up without him. Only someone who spent 10 years in prison can judge his decisions,\u201d she told the Interfax news agency.Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Putin, indicated that Khodorkovsky had admitted wrongdoing in a letter to the Russian president.\u201cHis amnesty request to the president has been submitted. If he is asking to be pardoned, this means he is admitting guilt,\u201d Peskov told Interfax. The oligarch who stood firm Khodorkovsky was one of the first generation of Russian oligarchs who parlayed close ties with the Kremlin to win lucrative assets during controversial privatizations in the 1990s after the Soviet Union fell apart. These men, who had grown up in a political climate in which private wealth was taboo, seized the opportunity to build vast oil, metals and banking empires that underpinned Russia\u2019s economy. Extremely rich and politically influential, the oligarchs were resented by many ordinary Russians, who saw them as no more than robber barons. Boris Yeltsin, Russia\u2019s first president, looked to the oligarchy for support and largely turned a blind eye to the often bloody battles between rival groups competing for the crown jewels of the economy. When Putin came to power in 2000, he moved to rein in the oligarchs and reassert state control over Russia\u2019s strategic natural resources. Some oligarchs fled in the early Putin years, sensing that the game was up.But oil prices were soaring, and Khodorkovsky, who had built Yukos into Russia\u2019s biggest oil producer, decided to challenge Putin. Without seeking Kremlin approval, Yukos began negotiating a strategic tie-up with Exxon and planning to build a privately owned oil export pipeline to China. Khodorkovsky also turned to philanthropy and began funding liberal and opposition groups, which angered Putin.After Khodorkovsky was arrested, Yukos was dismantled and sold off at bankruptcy auctions. Rosneft, Russia\u2019s state oil company, was the main beneficiary of the sales. Amnesty decision Putin announced the decision to pardon Khodorkovsky one day after Russia\u2019s parliament approved an amnesty clearing the way for the early release of hundreds of prisoners. Speaking after the news conference, Putin confirmed that the amnesty would apply to two members of the Pussy Riot punk band and 30 Greenpeace activists who are awaiting trial on bail in Russia after staging an offshore protest against Arctic drilling. In a dramatic development, three of the defendants in the Bolotnaya case were released Thursday in a Moscow courtroom, where they were on trial for participating in mass riots at an anti-government rally last year. In all, 27 Russians have been charged in connection with the disturbances that took place on the eve of Putin\u2019s inauguration to a third term in May 2012.

In recent days, more and more high-level international officials have announced their intention to stay away from Sochi.</p><p>The amnesty offers the West an unforeseen opportunity to mend deteriorating relations with Russia, said Rojansky, a longtime Russia scholar. \u201cYou have to welcome it and demonstrate for the Russian people that you take this seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very cynical, it\u2019s very smart, and it\u2019s very Putin.\u201d</p><p>Khodorkovsky, once the fabulously wealthy founder of the Yukos oil corporation, has been behind bars since 2003, when he was arrested at gunpoint in Siberia on charges of fraud and tax evasion. In Russia, where the courts regularly take orders directly from political authorities, the case was widely seen as a warning from Putin. He would tolerate no challenge, and anyone who dared to defy him could expect to share the fate of Khodorkovsky, who had angered Putin by financing political opposition to him.</p><p>After a news conference Thursday, Putin told reporters that he planned to sign an order pardoning Khodorkovsky \u201cin the nearest time.\u201d Khodorkovsky has served 10 years in jail and was due out in August. \u201cIt\u2019s a serious term,\u201d Putin said. </p><p>Even as the amnesty was being prepared, it appeared that Khodorkovsky would not be included. He has faced two trials. The first, in which he was found guilty of tax evasion and fraud in 2005, was followed by a trial in 2010 in which he was accused of stealing all of the oil produced at Yukos during the years he served as head of the company. Khodorkovsky has consistently denied those charges.</p><p>Over the past few weeks, senior Russian lawmakers have indicated that a fresh case was being prepared against Khodorkovsky that could preclude his release in 2014.</p><p>However, before announcing plans to pardon Khodorkovsky on Thursday, Putin said a third case against the prisoner was unlikely to materialize. </p><p>\u201cI do not understand at all where the case is. I have heard that they talk about it, but for now I do not see any threats for anyone there,\u201d Putin said at the news conference.\u00a0</p><p>Explaining the decision to release Khodorkovsky, Putin said the jailed tycoon had written a letter appealing for clemency, saying that his mother was ill.\u00a0</p><p>However, Vadim Klyuvgant, an attorney for Khodorkovsky, was unable to confirm that his client had asked for a pardon. \u201cWe don\u2019t have this information, although we\u2019ve received a number of pardon appeals on his behalf from other people over the years,\u201d he said.\u00a0</p><p>According to the Russian constitution, the president has the power to pardon prisoners without first receiving an appeal for clemency, Klyuvgant told the Russian radio station Ekho Moskvy.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Khodorkovsky\u2019s mother, Marina Khodorkovsky, said she had not seen her son since July and had received no information that he\u00a0planned to appeal for clemency. \u201cHe needs to be released \u2014 his children and even grandchildren grew up without him. Only someone who spent 10 years in prison can judge his decisions,\u201d she told the Interfax news agency.</p><p>Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Putin, indicated that Khodorkovsky had admitted wrongdoing in a letter to the Russian president.</p><p>\u201cHis amnesty request to the president has been submitted. If he is asking to be pardoned, this means he is admitting guilt,\u201d Peskov told Interfax.</p><p>\n<strong>The oligarch who stood firm</strong>\n</p><p>Khodorkovsky was one of the first generation of Russian oligarchs who parlayed close ties with the Kremlin to win lucrative assets during controversial privatizations in the 1990s after the Soviet Union fell apart. </p><p>These men, who had grown up in a political climate in which private wealth was taboo, seized the opportunity to build vast oil, metals and banking empires that underpinned Russia\u2019s economy. Extremely rich and politically influential, the oligarchs were resented by many ordinary Russians, who saw them as no more than robber barons. </p><p>Boris Yeltsin, Russia\u2019s first president, looked to the oligarchy for support and largely turned a blind eye to the often bloody battles between rival groups competing for the crown jewels of the economy. </p><p>When Putin came to power in 2000, he moved to rein in the oligarchs and reassert state control over Russia\u2019s strategic natural resources. Some oligarchs fled in the early Putin years, sensing that the game was up.</p><p>But oil prices were soaring, and Khodorkovsky, who had built Yukos into Russia\u2019s biggest oil producer, decided to challenge Putin. </p><p>Without seeking Kremlin approval, Yukos began negotiating a strategic tie-up with Exxon and planning to build a privately owned oil export pipeline to China. Khodorkovsky also turned to philanthropy and began funding liberal and opposition groups, which angered Putin.</p><p>After Khodorkovsky was arrested, Yukos was dismantled and sold off at bankruptcy auctions. Rosneft, Russia\u2019s state oil company, was the main beneficiary of the sales.\u00a0</p><p>\n<strong>Amnesty decision</strong>\n</p><p>Putin announced the decision to pardon Khodorkovsky one day after Russia\u2019s parliament approved <a data-xslt=\"_http\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/russian-lawmakers-approve-amnesty-that-could-affect-pussy-riot-greenpeace-activists/2013/12/18/fb803abe-67fc-11e3-8b5b-a77187b716a3_story.html\">an amnesty</a> clearing the way for the early release of hundreds of prisoners.\u00a0</p><p>Speaking after the news conference, Putin confirmed that the amnesty would apply to two members of the <a data-xslt=\"_http\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/pussy-riot-generates-outrage-in-russia-acclaim-in-the-west/2013/06/09/c287c842-d127-11e2-a73e-826d299ff459_story.html\">Pussy Riot punk band</a> and 30 Greenpeace activists who are awaiting trial on bail in Russia after staging an offshore protest against Arctic drilling.\u00a0</p><p>In a dramatic development, three of the defendants in <a data-xslt=\"_http\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/trial-of-bolotnaya-12-seen-as-a-warning-against-challenging-the-kremlin/2013/10/29/5e1dec92-381f-11e3-89db-8002ba99b894_story.html\">the Bolotnaya case</a> were released Thursday in a Moscow courtroom, where they were on trial for participating in mass riots at an anti-government rally last year.\u00a0</p><p>In all, 27 Russians have been charged in connection with the disturbances that took place on the eve of Putin\u2019s inauguration to a third term in May 2012.

The soldier-turned-statesman died on Saturday, aged 85. He had been in a coma since suffering a stroke in 2006 when he was at the peak of his political career. He was an iconic figure for some, but a controversial one for others - a man simultaneously hailed as a war hero and derided as a \u2018butcher\u2019. A full state funeral was planned for Sharon, who became known as \u2018the bulldozer\u2019 for his uncompromising attitude towards Palestinian diplomacy. The difference between him and other right wing leaders is that he wouldn't hesitate in pursuing massacres or war crimes in order to achieve political objectives; he might be a soldier but that doesn't tell a lot because there are good soldiers and there are bad soldiers and I think Sharon was a bad soldier in the moral sense. Ghassan Khatib, a professor at Bir Zeit University Thousands of Israeli citizens have been paying their last respects, as Sharon's body lay in state outside the Israeli parliament in Jerusalem. His life was closely intertwined with the country's history, reflecting the complex link between security, peace and politics. But it was punctuated by both stunning victories, and disastrous mistakes. Sharon fought in most of Israel\u2019s wars, first gaining notoriety in the 1967 Six Day War that saw Israel attack Egypt, Jordan and Syria. During the 1973 Yom Kippur War, he earned the nickname \u2018The Lion of God\u2019. As defence minister during the Lebanon War he was held indirectly responsible for the 1983 massacre of Palestinians at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps, earning him a different title: The \u2018Butcher of Beirut\u2019. A controversial visit to the grounds of the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem in 2000 led to the second Palestinian uprising. It increased his popularity in Israel and, within months, he became prime minister. Sharon was an early proponent of building settlements on occupied land, but in 2005, he appeared to have a change of heart, ordering all settlers and troops out of the Gaza Strip. It has raised the question about what the greater significance of that gesture may have been, had he remained in office. He had reached the height of his career, and looked certain to win a landslide victory with his new Kadima party when he suffered a massive stroke in 2006 that put him in a coma. Leading the tributes, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: \"I believe that his [Sharon\u2019s] memory as one of the most outstanding leaders and daring commanders will remain in the hearts of the Israeli people for eternity.\" In contrast to the Palestinian view.

Police said they haven't determined why Cody Cousins, 23, shot Andrew Boldt, a 21-year-old teaching assistant from West Bend, Wisconsin, inside the school's electrical engineering building around noon on Tuesday. Purdue police chief John Cox said witnesses believed the shooting was \"an intentional act\" but said there was no immediate indication that Cousins and Boldt had had disagreements in the past. No one else was injured. Cousins is being held at the Tippecanoe county jail on a preliminary charge of murder. The shooting at the school about 60 miles north-west of Indianapolis prompted the Purdue president, Mitch Daniels, to cut short a week-long university trip to Colombia and cancel classes on Tuesday and Wednesday. \"Violent crime, whenever and wherever it occurs, shocks our conscience and incites our rage. When it happens in our home, to a family member \u2013 and as a Boilermaker Andrew Boldt was family to us \u2013 those emotions are more powerful still,\" Daniels said in a statement read on Tuesday night at a campus vigil, which was attended by hundreds of people. University officials praised the police response, but the shooting left many students jittery. \"I heard a couple [shots] and then I heard a man scream,\" said sophomore Nick Wieland, who told the Journal Courier that he was in a classroom adjacent to the room where the shooting occurred. \"Then the last few kind of trailed off as I got under my desk. [I was] just very scared. That's what I felt the entire time.\" Cousins surrendered to a police officer outside the building after firing four or five shots, Cox said. Former teachers described Boldt, an Eagle Scout, as someone who loved robotics and computers and was always willing to help others with technology issues. He spent two summers interning for John Deere in Silvis, Illinois, according to his LinkedIn profile. Jean Morrell, Boldt's calculus teacher at Milwaukee's Marquette University high school, recalled how he frequently stayed after class to talk to her about math concepts, robotics and his dreams of attending Purdue, Morrell's alma mater. \"Andrew Boldt was a young man who had the potential to make the world a better place.

Tiger Woods was nine shots behind Speith at Torrey Pines. Phil Mickelson said he withdrew after wrestling with back muscle pain. Jordan Spieth showed maturity beyond his 20 years to take a one-shot lead at the Farmers Insurance Open by shooting a 9-under 63 on Friday. Skip to next paragraph Subscribe Today to the Monitor Click Here for your FREE 30 DAYS ofThe Christian Science MonitorWeekly Digital Edition Spieth played his round on the easier North Course at Torrey Pines while second-placed Stewart Cink had a 71 on the South.Spieth achieved the rare feat of upstaging his playing partner Tiger Woods, who has won eight tournaments at the course, including last year's event and the 2008 U.S. Open. Woods, in his first competition in six weeks, did not make birdie on any of the par 5s for the second straight day, and a three-putt bogey on the par-5 ninth hole on the North gave him a 71.Woods was nine shots behind, but at least he was still in the tournament, unlike long-time rival Phil Mickelson, who completed the second round but then withdrew due to back muscle pain. Mickelson shot a 1-over 73 on the South Course in the second round, leaving him eight strokes behind Spieth. Mickelson said after the round that he feared getting into bad habits by altering his swing to keep his back from hurting.His management company released a statement late Friday evening that Mickelson had decided to withdraw. He is scheduled to defend his title next week in the Phoenix Open.It was the first time Spieth has played with Woods in a tournament, and he seemed to relish it.\"Any time you can shoot a lower score than a 66 or 65 and you can really get it deep and be in a zone and not worry about what your score is ... that's special,\" Spieth said. \"That's proving that I can play my best golf when it matters on a PGA Tour venue. Each time you can do that, you get more and more confident that you can do it more often.\"Spieth was at 10-under 134 and will be in the last group Saturday with Cink and Nicolas Colsaerts, who shot 67 on the South and was two shots behind.\"I'm looking forward to playing with Jordan. I've never seen him hit a ball, so that will be fun,\" Cink said. \"It's always exciting to see the young guys play. I'm playing really well.\"The final two rounds will be on the South, which is about 600 yards longer and on Friday played more than 4-\u00bd shots harder.\"The kid's got talent,\" Woods said of Spieth. \"He hits it a long way, phenomenal putter. He made a boat load of putts today from the 10- to 20-foot range. He was pouring them in there.\"That wasn't the case for Woods, whose only birdies came on his opening hole and on his sixth hole.\"I was just a fraction off, and at this level and on golf courses like this, if you're just a fraction off it doesn't take much, especially as tight as the North Course is,\" Woods said. \"I had so many balls that landed in the fairway that went in the rough. Now I can't be aggressive, I've got to play conservative into some of these flags.\"The cut was at even-par 144, and 83 players advanced. There will be another cut to top 70 and ties after the third round.Woods wasn't ruling himself out just yet. He remembered the time he made the cut by two shots in 1999, and then had a 62-65 weekend to win by two shots. But that was before the South Course was lengthened. This year, no-one had better than 67 over the first two rounds on the South. Copyright 2014 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Woods, in his first competition in six weeks, did not make birdie on any of the par 5s for the second straight day, and a three-putt bogey on the par-5 ninth hole on the North gave him a 71.</p><p>Woods was nine shots behind, but at least he was still in the tournament, unlike long-time rival Phil\u00a0Mickelson, who completed the second round but then withdrew due to back muscle pain.</p>\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n<p>Mickelson shot a 1-over 73 on the South Course in the second round, leaving him eight strokes behind Spieth. Mickelson said after the round that he feared getting into bad habits by altering his swing to keep his back from hurting.</p><p>His management company released a statement late Friday evening that Mickelson had decided to withdraw. He is scheduled to defend his title next week in the Phoenix Open.</p><p>It was the first time Spieth has played with Woods in a tournament, and he seemed to relish it.</p><p>\"Any time you can shoot a lower score than a 66 or 65 and you can really get it deep and be in a zone and not worry about what your score is ... that's special,\" Spieth said. \"That's proving that I can play my best golf when it matters on a PGA Tour venue. Each time you can do that, you get more and more confident that you can do it more often.\"</p><p>Spieth was at 10-under 134 and will be in the last group Saturday with Cink and Nicolas Colsaerts, who shot 67 on the South and was two shots behind.</p><p>\"I'm looking forward to playing with Jordan. I've never seen him hit a ball, so that will be fun,\" Cink said. \"It's always exciting to see the young guys play. I'm playing really well.\"</p><p>The final two rounds will be on the South, which is about 600 yards longer and on Friday played more than 4-\u00bd shots harder.</p><p>\"The kid's got talent,\" Woods said of Spieth. \"He hits it a long way, phenomenal putter. He made a boat load of putts today from the 10- to 20-foot range. He was pouring them in there.\"</p><p>That wasn't the case for Woods, whose only birdies came on his opening hole and on his sixth hole.</p><p>\"I was just a fraction off, and at this level and on golf courses like this, if you're just a fraction off it doesn't take much, especially as tight as the North Course is,\" Woods said. \"I had so many balls that landed in the fairway that went in the rough. Now I can't be aggressive, I've got to play conservative into some of these flags.\"</p><p>The cut was at even-par 144, and 83 players advanced. There will be another cut to top 70 and ties after the third round.</p><p>Woods wasn't ruling himself out just yet. He remembered the time he made the cut by two shots in 1999, and then had a 62-65 weekend to win by two shots. But that was before the South Course was lengthened. This year, no-one had better than 67 over the first two rounds on the South.</p>\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\n<p class=\" text-center\">Copyright 2014 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Now to Brazil and reports of beheadings, murder, and rape at a prison in the north of the country. The United Nations has called for an investigation after a graphic video surfaced from inside the jail. (SOUNDBITE OF A VIDEO) CORNISH: The footage shows decapitated, mutilated prisoners allegedly killed by a rival gang. The violence has spilled into the streets outside the prison on orders of imprisoned gang leaders. NPR's Lourdes Garcia-Navarro is on the line from Sao Paulo. And before we begin, a word of warning to our listeners, this story involves graphic descriptions of violence. Lourdes, start by telling us where this prison is and how this video came to light. LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, BYLINE: Well, everyone knew for a long time that this complex of prisons called Pedrinhas, in Maranhao State, was completely lawless and out of control, Audie. Last year alone there were 60 deaths there. In fact, it's much more likely that you'd been killed inside that prison than outside of it, statistically. There were reports that inmates' wives were being raped during conjugal visits - just really a violent place. And so, the security forces launched a crackdown in late December. But the gangs' reach extends well beyond the prison walls and they ordered a retaliation. So, last week in Maranhao State, we saw attacks on police stations and several civilian buses were set on fire, on the orders apparently of gang leaders inside the prison. In one tragic story, one little girl - she was six years old - she was set on fire and she later died in the hospital. Her great-grandfather, when he heard the terrible news, then died of a heart attack. It's just something that's gripping the country right now. CORNISH: And it's obviously sent shockwaves through Brazil. GARCIA-NAVARRO: It has. The violence is part of a continuing struggle for power between two gangs inside the jail. Just to show you how out of control things were, when military police took over the jail, they found 300 improvised weapons, including knives and machetes in addition to drugs, alcohol, mobile phones. Outside the prison, now to prevent more arson attacks, Maranhao police have banned the sale of jerry cans that can contain gasoline. Drivers can only fill up their tanks directly at the pump. CORNISH: And you were talking about the reputation of this prison, but generally, Brazil's prisons are considered the worst and most overcrowded in the region. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, to be honest, there's tough competition in the region for that top spot. Latin American prisons are generally known to be terrible. But Brazil has a massive prison population, 550,000 people are incarcerated here. There's been a surge in jail sentences in the last few decades. But they are vastly overcrowded because, while the prison population has grown, there aren't many new prisons being built - so, more people, not more space. Inmates complained of having to eat raw chicken and rice, of having no place to sleep. Many human rights organizations decry the conditions inside Brazil's prisons. CORNISH: Tell us more about the state the prison is located. I understand it's among the poorest in the country. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, what's really interesting about the state is that it's run almost like a fiefdom of the Sarney family. The family owns most of the land. They own the main paper. They own radio stations. They own the TV stations. And not incidentally, they sit in the governor's mansion. Governor Roseanna Sarney is the daughter of former President Jose Sarney. There have been five decades of Sarney family ruled there - really highlighting, I think, some of the problems in Brazil regarding political corruption. So there's been a lot of focus on that in the papers here, while this crisis has unfolded; how the governor is ordering lobster and shrimp to entertain in the governor's mansion while the state, quote-unquote, \"burns.\" The state is the second poorest in the country and it has one of the highest rates of illiteracy in Brazil, at nearly 21 percent. But the Sarney family is one of Brazil's richest. CORNISH: That's NPR's Lourdes Garcia-Navarro in Sao Paulo. And there's been reaction from Brazil's federal government. Earlier this week, the Justice Ministry announced plans to transfer prison gang leaders from Maranhao State to federal jails. Copyright \u00a9 2014 NPR. All rights reserved.

Lisa Hechesky /Reuters/Landov On Saturday in South Charleston, W.Va., Cathy Mabe was one of many who came to get water from a temporary filling station. Lisa Hechesky /Reuters/Landov Relief is finally arriving for the 300,000 or so people in nine West Virginia counties who haven't been able to drink, cook or clean with their tap water for more than four days. Officials announced at noon Monday that tests show the level of a potentially harmful chemical have fallen to the point where the water can be turned back on. But, they cautioned that the process of bringing customers back on line will take several days and has to be done systematically. On 'Morning Edition': Ashton Marra reports from West Virginia They urged water users in the affected areas to go to the website of West Virginia American Water, where a zone-by-zone schedule and map has been posted. As each zone is given the clearance, customers are being asked to follow a three-step process: 1. Turn on all hot water taps for 15 minutes. 2. Turn on cold water taps for 5 minutes. 3. Turn on any outdoor taps for an additional 5 minutes. Those steps should flush any tainted water out of their pipes. There's additional guidance for how to deal with dishwashers, clothes washers and other appliances. Customers are being asked NOT to start flushing their systems until their zone is given the OK. If all customers in the affected area turned on their taps at the same time, they said, the system would not be able to supply enough water. The chemical, as we've been reporting, seeped into the Elk River near Charleston from a facility that treats coal. Our original post \u2014 'Just A Few More Days' And W. Va. Water Emergency May End \u2014 picks up the story: Phrases such as \"light at the end of the tunnel\" are being used by officials in West Virginia as they give about 300,000 people there hope that they'll soon be able to use the water that's supplied to their homes and businesses. It was last Thursday, as we reported, when a chemical used in coal processing leaked into the Elk River near Charleston and then into the region's water supply system. Residents and businesses across nine counties were warned not to use the water coming from their taps because the chemical \u2014 methylcyclohexene methanol \u2014 can cause severe burning in the throat, vomiting and skin blistering. Since Thursday, state and federal officials have been trucking water into the affected counties. About 10 people, according to Charleston's Sunday Gazette-Mail, have been hospitalized \"with symptoms consistent with chemical exposure. ... An additional 169 people have been treated at hospitals and released.\" Now, as West Virginia Public Broadcasting's Ashton Marra tells Morning Edition, \"we have some sort of idea that things are moving in the right direction. We're hoping [it may] be just a few more days\" before the all-clear is given. Officials, she said, are testing the water. Once they're confident that the chemical has dissipated, they'll then begin flushing the entire nine-county system \u2014 a process that will include asking homeowners to run their taps. Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin, D, said over the weekend that the test results \"are trending in the right direction.\" That led him, as the Sunday Gazette-Mail reported, to say \"we are at a point where we can say that we see light at the end of the tunnel.\" According to the Gazette-Mail: \"Once water is found acceptable for normal use, flushing can begin \u2014 zone by zone \u2014 to not strain the system. ... \"The zones where flushing would begin first include downtown Charleston, the East End Kanawha City, South Charleston, the West Side and North Charleston. Those areas include four major hospitals. \"An Internet based mapping system is being created for customers to search their home or business address to see what zone they are in and if they should begin flushing. It will be available at www.westvirginiaamwater.com, but it is not yet live. A 24-hour hotline is also being established, officials announced.\" Life in the affected counties, Ashton says, has been frustrating. \"You obviously can't cook, you can't clean, you can't bathe in any of that running water that you typically use. ... To have clean clothes, to be able to take a shower \u2014 some people are having to drive as much as 40 minutes to find another place to do these things where the water is still running and they're still able to use it.\" There's much more about the water crisis and what lies ahead for people in the affected area on West Virginia Public Broadcasting's website, including these posts: \u2014 End of Outage May Be in Sight for Water Customers, Businesses \u2014 7 Things We Know About the Chemical Spill in West Virginia \u2014 West Virginians Angry About Spill; Still Want Chemical, Coal Jobs \u2014 AUDIO: Tomblin's Sunday Briefing / Water Company to Establish Website for Clearing 'Zones'", "title": "Slowly, Water Is Flowing Again In West Virginia", "_id": 101455718, "tags": null, "source": "http://www.npr.org/rss/rss.php?id=1003", "updated": "Mon, 13 Jan 2014 07:00:00 -0500", "html": "<html><body><div><div id=\"storytext\" class=\"storytext storylocation linkLocation\">\n      <div id=\"res262048049\" class=\"bucketwrap image large\" previewtitle=\"On Saturday in South Charleston, W.Va., Cathy Mabe was one of many who came to get water from a temporary filling station.\">\n            \n      \n\n      <div class=\"captionwrap\">\n                  <div class=\"caption\">\n                        <p><b class=\"hide-caption\"><b>hide caption</b></b>On Saturday in South Charleston, W.Va., Cathy Mabe was one of many who came to get water from a temporary filling station.</p>\n         </div>\n         \n\n      </div>\n      \n\n      <span class=\"creditwrap\"><span class=\"credit\">Lisa Hechesky </span>/<span class=\"rightsnotice\">Reuters/Landov</span></span>      <div class=\"enlarge_measure\">\n                  <div class=\"img_wrap\">\n                        <img data-original=\"http://media.npr.org/assets/img/2014/01/13/watercrisis132way_custom-d4a699fb3d6e92be9e62df597a4da9fe940ca348-s51.jpg\" title=\"On Saturday in South Charleston, W.Va., Cathy Mabe was one of many who came to get water from a temporary filling station.\" alt=\"On Saturday in South Charleston, W.Va., Cathy Mabe was one of many who came to get water from a temporary filling station.\"/>\n         </div>\n         \n\n      </div>\n      \n\n      <div class=\"enlarge_html\">\n                  <div class=\"image_data\">\n                        <p class=\"caption\">On Saturday in South Charleston, W.Va., Cathy Mabe was one of many who came to get water from a temporary filling station.</p>             <span class=\"creditwrap\"><span class=\"credit\">Lisa Hechesky </span>/<span class=\"rightsnotice\">Reuters/Landov</span></span>\n         </div>\n         \n\n      </div>\n      \n\n   </div>\n   <p>Relief is finally arriving for the 300,000 or so people in nine West Virginia counties who haven't been able to drink, cook or clean with their tap water for more than four days.</p>   <p>Officials announced at noon Monday that tests show the level of a potentially harmful chemical have fallen to the point where the water can be turned back on.

The culprit, a high pressure ridge parked offshore that is blocking winter storms. While much of the United States has experienced a weather year with fewer extremes and an easing drought, the record-breaking California drought \u2013 the worst since 1895 \u2013 is not leaving the region anytime soon, according to climatologists. Skip to next paragraph Subscribe Today to the Monitor Click Here for your FREE 30 DAYS ofThe Christian Science MonitorWeekly Digital Edition The unseasonal balmy but dry weather is the result of an equally unprecedented high pressure ridge lurking offshore and blocking the typical winter storms needed to drop precipitation all along the West Coast.This ridge has persisted for 13 months and the longer it lingers, the less likely it is to leave, points out climatologist Brian Fuchs, from the National Drought Mitigation Center in Lincoln, Nebraska. This high pressure ridge system is feeding on itself, \u201ccreating a sort of perfect environment for perpetuating the dry conditions\u201d it creates, he says. High-pressure systems are not uncommon, but it is abnormal for them to hang around uninterrupted for so long. \u201cThis makes it even harder as winter storms approach for them to break through and change that pattern,\u201d he adds.This recent dry spell accentuates a continuing background condition of prevailing drought across much of the Southwestern US, notes Christopher Williams, a specialist in US drought conditions and an assistant professor at Clark University\u2019s Graduate School of Geography in Worcester, Mass.Precipitation is below 20 percent of normal and signs of the drought impact run across the region, including low river flows, low snow packs, low reservoir levels, and out-of-season wildfires.\u201cWintertime shortages are particularly worrisome,\u201d adds Mr. Williams via e-mail, \u201cbecause winter is a key time of year for building up water supplies that carry the West through the rest of the year.\u201d What is worse, he says, \u201cshortfalls extend well beyond the state of California itself, reaching nearly all of the remote regions on which the California water supply network relies, particularly the Colorado River Basin.\u201dScientists are uncertain as to why the ridge has stubbornly refused to break down and allow incoming storms to hit land. Climate change may be one of many factors, suggests Mr. Fuchs. \u201cIt\u2019s always difficult to know if a specific disaster or storm is tied to climate change,\u201d he says, but over the course of decades it is possible to see large trends moving in a certain direction. \u201cYou can\u2019t really pinpoint one thing, but you can say that over a period of decades there is less snow accumulation and warmer temperatures, and climate change is playing a part in that,\u201d he adds.On Friday, California Gov. Jerry Brown declared a drought emergency, calling for a 20-percent voluntary conservation effort state-wide.This is just the beginning, says Doug Parker, director of the California Institute for Water Resources. \u201cWe have seen essentially no rain or snowfall this year and short- and long-term forecasts are bleak for California,\u201d says Mr. Parker via e-mail, adding that this means that California will have very low water deliveries to much of its agricultural sector.This agriculture is an important part of the state\u2019s economy, points out Parker. \u201cThis will lead to fallowing of farmland which will reduce output and reduce employment,\u201d he suggests, adding that could drive up the prices of certain commodities. In addition, the dairy and meat sectors will be particularly hard hit, he notes, as those sectors will have to import feed.The drought throughout the West will impact other states similarly, points out Parker.The drought will increase pressure on already over-used groundwater supplies, says Parker. \u201cWe have seen dropping groundwater levels in many parts of the state. We expect growers to increase use of groundwater, especially for tree and vine crops. This will accelerate the decline in groundwater,\u201d he adds.Little currently on the horizon offers much hope for change, says California climatologist Mike Anderson, with the Department of Water Resources.This offshore ridge is very stable, he says, adding, \u201cthis is good news if you want nice weather, but if you want precipitation it is not.\u201d", "title": "California drought: Scientists puzzled by persistence of blocking 'ridge'", "_id": 105257822, "tags": null, "source": "http://rss.csmonitor.com/feeds/usa", "updated": "", "html": "<html><body><div><p>Many states have seen an easing of drought conditions, but not California, mired in its worst in more than a century.

Andrew Burton/Getty Images Newly released documents depict officials discussing the controversial September closure of several lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge from Fort Lee, N.J. Here, the New Jersey side of the bridge, which leads to New York City, is seen Thursday. Andrew Burton/Getty Images A New Jersey State Assembly committee released a trove of documents Friday that shed more light on the bridge lane-closure scandal that is embroiling Republican Gov. Chris Christie's administration. The panel is seeking details on what's seen as an act of political retribution, which targeted the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, N.J. It obtained the documents under a subpoena. The lane closures, which were blamed for causing severe congestion on four consecutive days in Fort Lee in early September, are referred to as a \"new traffic pattern\" and a \"trial\" in the documents, which include emails and text messages among transportation, government and police officials. They also include notes of frustration from commuters, including one woman who accused Port Authority officials who control the bridge of \"playing God with people's jobs,\" as The New York Times reports. The restriction of traffic from three lanes down to one on the George Washington Bridge, which links Fort Lee to Manhattan, has since been called an act of political bullying by some. Christie denied those charges Thursday, apologizing to the mayor of Fort Lee and saying, \"I am not a bully.\" The documents released today by the Assembly's Democratic-controlled Transportation, Public Works and Independent Authorities Committee drew from these sources: David M. Wildstein \u2014 former director of interstate capital projects for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (resigned in December) William E. Baroni Jr. \u2014 former Port Authority deputy executive director (resigned in December) Robert Durando \u2014 general manager of the George Washington Bridge Patrick J. Foye \u2014 executive director of the Port Authority Cedrick Fulton \u2014 director of the Port Authority's Tunnels, Bridges, and Terminals Division Darcy Licorish \u2014 inspector in the Port Authority Police Department Paul Nunziato \u2014 president of the Port Authority Police Benevolent Association, a union that includes many police officers Licorish, who passed along orders to place cones on the roadway and delivered updates on the closure to other officials, submitted an email dated Friday, Sept. 13, in which she summarizes some of the workings behind the closure. The police inspector says the bridge's general manager, Robert Durando, informed her of the impending \"new traffic pattern\" on Friday, Sept. 6, days before the change was instituted. She says she did not receive answers to several questions, including whether the plan was permanent or temporary and whether the local township had been notified. In a Sept. 10 email submitted by Licorish, Durando writes, \"Just got off the phone with DW. He'd like to continue the test of tl 24 through tomorrow.\" DW would refer to Wildstein, we presume. It seems \"tl 24\" refers to a toll lane near the bridge's entry point. NPR and other news agencies are sifting through the documents. Because of the intense interest in the files, download times on the New Jersey site were slowed to a crawl for some users. We'll add more details to this post as stories emerge. The documents revealed Friday did not answer all of the Assembly committee's questions \u2014 especially those centering on allegations of an Aug. 13 email exchange and a meeting between Christie and David Samson, a former attorney general who went on to be chairman of the Port Authority. \"I think one of the most difficult issues that we confront in this entire inquiry is that as soon as we know more, we have more questions,\" said Assembly Deputy Speaker John Wisniewski, the panel's chairman, who is leading the inquiry. That quote comes from a transcript the Transportation panel published of its Thursday hearing with Wildstein. He visited the committee under subpoena Thursday, a session in which he repeatedly asserted his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination. During the hearing, the committee voted to hold Wildstein in contempt after, as Wisniewski said, the former transportation official refused to answer questions such as, \"Is this your e-mail? Where did you work? What was your job?\" In supporting the vote for contempt, Republican Assembly member Brian Rumpf said, \"And just to be clear... not only do I find the conduct to be one of contempt, I find the overall situation to be contemptuous.\" Near the end of the hearing, Wisniewski asked: \"Who in the Governor's Office knew about the plan to close the lanes or divert the lanes, who was involved, what did they know, when did they know it? And just as equally: Who was involved, what did they know, when did they know it when the effort was made to craft an explanation for the lane closure?\" The documents the panel has been given, he concluded, \"only tell part of the story.\" Wildstein's lawyer, Alan Zegas, responded, \"Well, if the Attorneys General for New Jersey, New York, and the United States were all to agree to clothe Mr. Wildstein with an immunity, I think that you'd find yourselves in a far different position with respect to the information he could provide.\" \"That's your job,\" Wisniewski said, as some in the room laughed. \"We just want answers to our questions.\"", "title": "N.J.

China's leaders bowed three times before a statue of Mao on Thursday, in carefully controlled celebrations. \"Mao is a great figure who changed the face of the nation and led the Chinese people to a new destiny,\" Xi said in Beijing, according to the official news agency Xinhua. Revolutionary leaders are not gods, but human beings. Xi Jinping, Chinese President But Xi also said that \"revolutionary leaders are not gods, but human beings\" and cannot be worshipped like gods. \"[We] cannot refuse to allow people to point out and correct their errors just because they are great,\" he said. \"Neither can we totally repudiate them and erase their historical feats just because they made mistakes,\" Xi added. The new president's approach underscored the delicate balancing act the Communist Party leadership, installed last year, has to perform in managing perceptions of Mao's legacy. In a sign of the relatively understated approach the party is taking with the anniversary, there was no mention of Mao's birthday on the front page of the party's flagship People's Daily. Instead it was relegated to page seven of the paper. Pro-Mao activists detained Even as celebrations continued, several said police had also detained pro-Mao activists from different provinces to prevent them from attending, highlighting the challenge Mao's legacy poses to the leadership. \"The police have intercepted many, many of us,\" said a man surnamed Wei, who held a banner with Mao's face and did not wish to give his full name for fear of reprisals. \"The government is not as upright as Chairman Mao, so they are afraid, they are all corrupt,\" he added. Meanwhile censors appeared to be busy scrubbing criticism of Mao off China's social media sites, with messages that questioned his legacy disappearing within minutes of being posted. Sixty-year cycle The 12-decade anniversary has a special resonance in China, which traditionally measured time in 60-year cycles. Near Mao's childhood home in Shaoshan, in the central province of Hunan, thousands of fans stood through the night and praised the founder of the People's Republic, who led the country for 27 years until his death in 1976. An estimated $320m was reportedly budgeted by the Shaoshan government for the anniversary, to cover a four-hour fireworks display and the feeding of free noodles, a traditional birthday meal, to thousands of spectators. Since Mao's death, the Chinese government has never allowed an open historical reckoning of his actions. Under Mao's leadership, China lurched between industrialisation drives and violent political campaigns. Mao's \"Great Leap Forward\" is estimated by Western historians to have led to as many as 45 million deaths from famine, and his Cultural Revolution plunged China into a decade of violent chaos. 484", "title": "China marks muted 120th birthday of Mao", "_id": 111219814, "tags": null, "source": "http://www.aljazeera.com/Services/Rss/?PostingId=2007722144444234906", "updated": "Thu, 26 Dec 2013 17:47:43 GMT", "html": "<html><body><div><td id=\"ctl00_cphBody_tdTextContent\" class=\"DetailedSummary\">&#13;\n            &#13;\n                <p>Communist China's President Xi Jinping has led\u00a0celebrations of\u00a0Mao Zedong's 120th birthday anniversary, praising the country's founding father whille acknowledging that\u00a0he made \"mistakes\" during his reign.</p>&#13;\n<p>China's leaders bowed three times before a statue of Mao on Thursday, in carefully controlled celebrations.</p>&#13;\n<p>\"Mao is a great figure who changed the face of the nation and led the Chinese people to a new destiny,\" Xi said in Beijing, according to the official news agency Xinhua.</p>&#13;\n<div>&#13;\n<table class=\"Skyscrapper_Body in-article-item quote\" border=\"0\">&#13;\n<tbody>&#13;\n<tr>&#13;\n<td>&#13;\n<p>Revolutionary leaders are not gods, but human beings.</p>&#13;\n<p class=\"quoted-author\">Xi Jinping, <span>Chinese President </span></p>&#13;\n</td>&#13;\n</tr>&#13;\n</tbody>&#13;\n</table>&#13;\n</div>&#13;\n<p>But Xi also\u00a0said that \"revolutionary leaders are not gods, but human beings\" and cannot be worshipped like gods.</p>&#13;\n<p>\"[We] cannot refuse to allow people to point out and correct their errors just because they are great,\" he said.</p>&#13;\n<p>\"Neither can we totally repudiate them and erase their historical feats just because they made mistakes,\" Xi added.</p>&#13;\n<p>The new president's approach underscored the delicate balancing act the Communist Party leadership,\u00a0installed last year,\u00a0has to perform in managing perceptions of Mao's legacy.</p>&#13;\n<p>In a sign of the relatively understated approach the party is taking with the anniversary, there was no mention of Mao's birthday on the front page of the party's flagship <em>People's Daily</em>.

South African companies have expanded across sub-Saharan Africa and are a vital economic engine for the continent. South Africa, diplomatically and militarily, is playing a leading role in efforts to defuse crises in Congo, the Central African Republic and other trouble spots on the continent.But at home, the record remains mixed, a place where Mandela\u2019s hopes and dreams remain largely unfulfilled. South Africa is a nation where racial and economic inequalities still tear through the consciousness of the black majority. Although some progress has been made, the majority of blacks live in poverty, and many still lack basic necessities such as electricity, proper housing and clean water. Education and health care for impoverished blacks remain poor. It is a nation where the economy is still largely controlled by whites and a relatively small group of black elites.\u201cThe cause of Mandela was that he articulated an aspiration for a non-racial democratic South Africa,\u201d said Robert Schrire, a political analyst at the University of Cape Town. \u201cBut the reality is that as long as whites are identified with wealth and blacks with poverty, genuine reconciliation will never be possible.\u201dMandela was hardly interested in the \u201cnitty-gritty of governing\u201d and focused on symbolic gestures to bring blacks and whites together, such as having tea with the widow of Hendrik Verwoerd, widely considered the architect of apartheid.\u201cPerhaps a criticism of Mandela, and I think it\u2019s a fair one, is that he concentrated too much on the symbolic side of reconciliation and didn\u2019t do nearly enough to try and bring a better life for the population,\u201d Schrire said.South Africa is also a nation where there\u2019s growing disillusionment with the ruling African National Congress (ANC), the party that Mandela helped create and nurture into the revolutionary force that dismantled apartheid. Today, the party and its leadership are facing allegations of corruption and of ignoring the needs of impoverished blacks, the very constituency that Mandela fought so long and hard to emancipate and empower. \u201cWe have pockets of individuals, institutions and groups who are pushing Mandela\u2019s ideals,\u201d said William Gumede, a political analyst. \u201cBut there has also been backsliding among the ANC leaders in espousing Mandela\u2019s hopes and dreams. His death has left a real gap, and the current leadership is not up to filling this gap.\u201dWhen he became South Africa\u2019s first black president after winning the nation\u2019s first multi-race elections in 1994, Mandela actively wooed foreign investors. Instead of nationalizing companies, he persuaded the ANC to move away from its socialist ethos and embrace a free and open economy, which fueled South Africa\u2019s economic growth for years. Today, however, that legacy is under fire. Unemployment remains at nearly 25 percent; white people on average earn six times more than their black counterparts. The ANC\u2019s youth wing has lobbied hard for the nationalization of banks and mines; according to the Municipal IQ, a Johannesburg-based research group, last year there were a record 173 protests, many of them violent, over a lack of housing, jobs and basic services. According to World Bank statistics, South Africa remains one of the world\u2019s most economically unequal societies.The most violent upheaval came in August 2012, when police killed 34 mine workers waging a strike at a platinum mine in the town of Marikana. It was the deadliest action by police in post-apartheid South Africa. The ANC responded by charging the striking miners with the murders of their co-workers, triggering popular anger at the storied party.Politically, allegations of corruption have touched the highest levels of office \u2014 something that would have been unthinkable under Mandela\u2019s single term in office. President Jacob Zuma is facing a government probe, accused of spending about $20 million in state funds to renovate his luxurious private residence in KwaZulu-Natal province. In 2006, he was acquitted of rape charges. In 2009, charges that he took bribes from arms dealers were dropped, paving the way for his presidency. \u2018I still feel there is racism\u2019 In the famed township of Soweto, on Vilakazi Street where Mandela once lived, youths protested and fought the apartheid regime in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Today, many young people here express concern about their future in a post-Mandela South Africa. \u201cMadiba wanted us to have peace and no racism,\u201d said Thandeke Belle, 14, a middle school student, using Mandela\u2019s clan name, as many people in South Africa do. \u201cI still feel there is racism although it was not as much as apartheid. The whites are still at the top, and we blacks are stuck down at the middle.\u201d\u201cPoor people are going to become poorer and the rich will get richer because of what\u2019s happening,\u201d said Belle\u2019s classmate, Thato Tshabale, 15, who was standing next to her. \u201cIf you are a normal person with no connections, you will be nothing in today\u2019s South Africa.\u201dTshabale said his ability to achieve his dreams of going to college and acquiring a healthy income are limited. \u201cI don\u2019t think apartheid has ended,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, in order for us to learn, we need money. But the whites always have money, and they get a lot more chances than blacks.\u201d Papallo Chapedi, 15, said his mother had been waiting more than 10 years for government-subsidized housing, while some of his friends\u2019 relatives were able to get housing because of their ties to the ANC. He criticized Zuma\u2019s leadership, saying that he \u201cdoes not even come close to Mandela\u201d in terms of what he has provided to South Africans.\u201cI feel a huge animosity towards the ANC,\u201d Chapedi said. \u201cIt\u2019s not empowering our needs. There is a lot of corruption; there\u2019s propaganda. I would like to see change.\u201d Successes and failures Patrick Hanratty, 64, had brought some Italian tourists to look at where Mandela had lived. For the white tour operator, Mandela\u2019s vision for South Africa had been partially realized.\u201cThere have been successes, and there have been failures,\u201d Hanratty said. \u201cWe are living in a society that has a measure of justice, whereas before we were living in a very unjust society. The feeling of guilt is still there of having benefited from the misfortune of our black brothers, but it is less than it used to be.\u201dHe added that whites \u201cstill live in a very privileged position,\u201d but he said this was also partly because the government was being careful not to alienate whites. \u201cYou can\u2019t dismantle an economy and make everybody equal,\u201d he said. \u201cTo do that would endanger the development of the country. The government is following a pragmatic approach. They don\u2019t want white flight. They want to keep as many skills and as much capital in the country\u201d as possible.Perhaps the biggest impact Mandela\u2019s vision has had on whites, Hanratty said, is that they are no longer ostracized by the world, particularly in Africa.\u201cYou can be a white South African and can go all the way to Cairo without being considered a pariah,\u201d Hanratty said. \u201cYou can show your passport with pride. South Africans can play sport anywhere in the world. This helps our national identity very much.\u201dDespite all the challenges South Africa faces upon Mandela\u2019s death, many South Africans expressed gratitude that they were led by a man who by example showed how leaders should govern their nation, imbued with the principles of democracy, justice and equality.\u201cHe was our [George] Washington,\u201d said Gumede, the political analyst. \u201cIn his personal and public life, he created a gold standard and way of governing that showed us how our leaders should govern. . . . We know what is possible. Not many leaders in Africa can set that kind of example.\u201d", "title": "South Africa still struggling to fulfill Mandela\u2019s hopes and dreams", "_id": 117580114, "tags": ["African National Congress", "Nelson Mandela", "gold standard"], "source": "http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/rss/world/africa", "updated": "Fri, 06 Dec 2013 23:14:00 GMT", "html": "<html><body><div><article>&#13;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>The nation, thanks in large part to Mandela, is no longer an international pariah but is able to participate freely in the global economy, sports and other arenas.

Their choice is a simple yes or no. Should the referendum that concludes on January 15th endorse a newly drafted constitution, as is widely expected, presidential and parliamentary elections will follow, probably in that order. By early summer, Egypt could reach the end of the \u201croad map\u201d laid out by its current military-backed regime, and realise at last the dream of a stable democracy that inspired its revolution in January 2011. Such is the scenario rosily painted by Egypt\u2019s now nearly monochrome media. But things are not so simple. A majority probably supports the country\u2019s present rulers, or at any rate is exhausted by three years of turbulence and yearns for calm at any price. Though Mr Morsi\u2019s Muslim Brotherhood will angrily reject the very notion of a referendum, some Islamists, notably the leading lights of the al-Azhar mosque and university in Cairo, are promoting a yes vote. So does the Salafist Nour party, though it espouses a more puritanical version of Islam than does the Brotherhood. Egypt remains starkly polarised, tense and embittered. In this sectionRelated topics For the Islamists who backed Mr Morsi, the reasons are plain. Just a year ago, following their victories in parliamentary and presidential elections, they seemed poised to assert full control over the most populous and pivotal Arab state. Now, after waves of mass arrests and successive, brutal police actions that have left hundreds killed, the Brotherhood has been chased underground. At least the top two tiers of its tightly disciplined command structure\u2014close to 1,000 men from a total membership of perhaps as many as 500,000\u2014are now in prison or exile. Dozens of senior leaders, including Mr Morsi, face trial and long sentences on charges ranging from murder to espionage. More than 700 have had their personal assets frozen, impoverishing their families, while the state has taken control of more than 1,000 Brotherhood-affiliated schools and charities. But the vengeful return of the security apparatus that dominated Egypt for 60 years before the revolution is casting wider fears. As before, the police, the public prosecution service, the courts and the state-owned or -influenced media are again working in lockstep to silence or discredit the regime\u2019s critics. A particular target, of late, has been the non-Islamist youth activists most responsible for instigating the uprising three years ago. Not only have half a dozen prominent revolutionaries been jailed or sent to trial on flimsy charges. With few, notable exceptions, Egypt\u2019s press has taken to picturing last year\u2019s heroes as today\u2019s enemies of the state. One \u201cpatriotic\u201d private television channel has aired intercepted phone calls between well-known activists. Though the conversations revealed nothing nefarious, the fact that the tapes could have been supplied only by security agencies has fuelled concern of a return to widespread government eavesdropping. This is precisely the point, says Bassem Youssef, a popular satirist whose ridicule undermined Mr Morsi but has not been tolerated by the current regime, either. People may laugh at clumsy attempts to defame dissidents, he argued in a recent column, just as people laugh at overzealous efforts to hunt out Brotherhood \u201csymbols\u201d in schoolbooks or in an advertisement featuring finger-puppets. But the very absurdity of the witch hunt helps generate fears of state power. Don\u2019t make the same mistake Just as Mr Morsi frittered away his initial popularity by riding roughshod over secular critics, so Egypt\u2019s current regime risks losing much of its support by overplaying its hand. Yet to the dismay of liberals, including an outnumbered few inside Egypt\u2019s government who have argued for conciliation and restraint, the Brotherhood and its allies keep handing pretexts to the regime\u2019s powerful \u201ceradicationist\u201d faction. Obstinately refusing to accept their fall from grace, the Brotherhood and its supporters continue to stage daily protests. Though mostly peaceful, the disruptions breed more resentment than sympathy. They have also been punctuated by violence, generally aimed at security installations, such as a bomb in the Nile Delta city of Mansoura on December 24th that killed 16 people. In response to that attack, Egypt\u2019s cabinet officially declared the movement to be a banned terrorist organisation, despite a notable lack of evidence and a more credible claim of responsibility from a jihadist group implicated in previous bombings. The drumbeat of violence, accompanied in Egypt\u2019s media by fawning praise for the forces of order, inspires yearnings among many for the emergence of an authority figure, not unlike past presidents-for-life. General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the army chief who led the coup, has so far shied from declaring whether he will run for president.

Interior Minister Miguel Rodriguez gave out his personal phone number during an address and asked police to call him to report corruption. \"New police will always have some great superiors, well-prepared ones. But they also are going to get some bad eggs. Report them fearlessly because their (corruption) undermines police authority for the Venezuelan people,\" Rodriguez said in the address carried on state television. \"Just give me the information right away, and we will rip the head off that immoral police superior,\" the minister warned. Venezuela has one of the world's highest murder rates, ranking 5th globally according to the United Nations. Monica Spear, a former Miss Venezuela who starred in a telenovela at the US-based Telemundo network, and her ex-husband became the latest casualty of her homeland's crime epidemic. The director of the Violence Observatory, Roberto Briceno, said the killings \"bring into relief a common reality of daily life in Venezuela,\" where his nonprofit group counted nearly 25,000 people slain last year, 79 for every 100,000 Venezuelans. Authorities only solve eight out of 100 homicides in Venezuela, emboldening criminals who have turned the South American nation into one of the world's most dangerous places outside war zones. Spear and her 39-year-old British ex-partner Henry Thomas Berry were shot dead on a northwestern Venezuelan highway after they resisted robbers who attacked their broken-down car in front of their five-year-old daughter, who was wounded.

Medical experts, however, warn against complacency as the threat of risk continues from porous borders that allow migration and spread of polio to India from Pakistan and Afghanistan. In 2013, isolated polio outbreaks reported in Syria and Horn of Africa made health experts cautious. Re-infection has been recorded of the endemic in countries such as Somalia. \u201cWe cannot let this happen to our country\u201d, said Raman Bhatia, member of India National PolioPlus Committee (INPPC) in a CNN IBN report. The WHO is expected to formally declare India as polio-free with an ascertaining report in March. Sustained campaign India\u2019s nationwide anti-polio campaign began with a vaccination programme in the mid-1990s. The federal government was supported by non-profit groups, UN agencies and prominent individuals including Bollywood stars who were roped for publicity of the campaign. India\u2019s PolioPlus campaign had 2,400,000 volunteers and more than 150,000 community workers to carry out the immunisation programme. The free polio vaccination cost the government Rs 1000 crore ($160 million). Reports say polio vaccinations are held 608 times annually and 2.3 million vaccinators are used to immunise more than 170 million children yearly. India\u2019s record of going polio-free for the last three years was called \u201ca monumental milestone\u201d by Nicole Deutsch, head of the polio operations for UN\u2019s children\u2019s arm UNICEF, reports say. 342", "title": "India marks three years without polio", "_id": 141366495, "tags": null, "source": "http://www.aljazeera.com/Services/Rss/?PostingId=2007721155716791636", "updated": "Mon, 13 Jan 2014 14:16:06 GMT", "html": "<html><body><div><td id=\"ctl00_cphBody_tdTextContent\" class=\"DetailedSummary\">&#13;\n            &#13;\n                <p>India is marking three years without any new recorded cases of polio - a feat that is expected to prompt the World Health Organisation (WHO) to declare the country polio-free in March.</p>&#13;\n<p>The war to eradicate polio has been one of India\u2019s public health success stories with a relentless and orchestrated public campaign to reach to the remotest corners of the country over a decade.\u00a0</p>&#13;\n<p>Until 2009, India accounted for more than half the world\u2019s polio cases, reports say.\u00a0</p>&#13;\n&#13;\n<p>An 18-month-old baby detected with polio in January 2011 in Howrah near the eastern city of Kolkata was the last reported case of the disease in the country.</p>&#13;\n<p>Medical experts, however, warn against complacency as the threat of risk continues from porous borders that allow migration and spread of polio to India from Pakistan and Afghanistan.\u00a0</p>&#13;\n<p>In 2013, isolated polio outbreaks reported in Syria and Horn of Africa made health experts cautious.\u00a0</p>&#13;\n<p>Re-infection has been recorded of the endemic in countries such as Somalia.</p>&#13;\n<p>\u201cWe cannot let this happen to our country\u201d,\u00a0 said Raman Bhatia, member of India National PolioPlus Committee (INPPC) in a CNN IBN report. \u00a0</p>&#13;\n<p>The WHO is expected to formally declare India as polio-free with an ascertaining report in March.</p>&#13;\n<p><strong>Sustained campaign</strong>\u00a0</p>&#13;\n<p>India\u2019s nationwide anti-polio campaign began with a vaccination programme in the mid-1990s.

The report, from Peter Gibson, comes from an inquiry intended to examine whether Britain was implicated in the mistreatment of detainees following the 9/11 attacks. But it was scrapped earlier this year after Libya alleged that Britain was complicit in \"rendition\" - capturing people suspected of terrorism and transferring them to third countries without legal process. Gibson found evidence that British spies had been aware of physical assault, sleep deprivation and the use of hoods. \"Officers were advised that, faced with apparent breaches of Geneva Convention standards, there was no obligation tointervene,\" he said in the report. Britain had been reluctant to complain about the ill-treatment of detainees for fear of damaging relations with allies, including the US, the report said. Allegations of torture In some cases, British officials failed to raise objections about renditions when they should have, while ministers were unaware of the operations. Britain's MI6 linked to Libya torture scandal After reviewing 20,000 documents, Gibson said he had found 27 issues that needed further investigation, including allegations of torture. \"Documents indicate that in some instances UK intelligence officers were aware of inappropriate interrogation techniques,\" the report said. \"(The) government or its agencies may have become inappropriately involved in some cases of rendition.\" In response the British government said on Thursday that a parliamentary committee would take over from Gibson's role and look at Gibson's outstanding concerns. Cabinet minister Ken Clarke said the inquiry's findings showed Britain's spy agencies had struggled to come to terms with the threat from armed groups after the 9/11 attacks. Unprepared and inadequate \"It is now clear that our agencies and their staff were in some respects not prepared for the extreme demands suddenlyplaced upon them,\" Clarke told parliament. \"Guidance regulating how intelligence officers should act was inadequate, the practices of some of our international partners should have been understood much sooner. Oversight was not robust enough.\" The heads of MI5 and MI6, Britain's domestic and overseas intelligence agencies, have repeatedly said they would never use, or encourage others to use, torture to gain information. In November 2010, however, Britain agreed to make payments to 16 former Guantanamo Bay detainees in settlements over claims they were mistreated abroad with the knowledge and in some cases complicity of British spies. 439", "title": "British spies 'knew of detainee abuse'", "_id": 142546045, "tags": null, "source": "http://www.aljazeera.com/Services/Rss/?PostingId=2007721152443657412", "updated": "Thu, 19 Dec 2013 20:22:10 GMT", "html": "<html><body><div><td id=\"ctl00_cphBody_tdTextContent\" class=\"DetailedSummary\">&#13;\n            &#13;\n                <p>British spies knew about detainee abuse but were told they did not have to intervene because they might damage relations with the US, a senior British judge has found.\u00a0</p>&#13;\n<p><a href=\"http://www.detaineeinquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/35100_Trafalgar-Text-accessible.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The report</a>, from Peter Gibson, comes from an inquiry intended to examine whether Britain was implicated in the mistreatment of detainees following the 9/11 attacks.</p>&#13;\n<p>But it was scrapped earlier this year after Libya alleged that Britain was complicit in \"rendition\" - capturing people suspected of terrorism and transferring them\u00a0to third countries without legal process.</p>&#13;\n<p>Gibson found evidence that British spies had been aware of physical assault, sleep\u00a0deprivation and the use of hoods.</p>&#13;\n<p>\"Officers were advised that, faced with apparent breaches of Geneva Convention standards, there was no obligation to<br/>intervene,\" he said in the report.</p>&#13;\n<p>Britain had been reluctant to complain about the ill-treatment of detainees for fear of damaging relations with allies, including the US, the report said.</p>&#13;\n<p><strong>Allegations of torture</strong></p>&#13;\n<p>In some cases, British officials failed to raise objections about renditions when they should have, while ministers were unaware of the operations.</p>&#13;\n<div>&#13;\n<table class=\"in-article-item video\" border=\"0\">&#13;\n<tbody>&#13;\n<tr>&#13;\n<td>&#13;\n&#13;\n</td>&#13;\n</tr>&#13;\n<tr>&#13;\n<td class=\"caption\">Britain's MI6 linked to Libya torture scandal</td>&#13;\n</tr>&#13;\n</tbody>&#13;\n</table>&#13;\n</div>&#13;\n<p>After reviewing 20,000 documents, Gibson said he had found 27 issues that needed further investigation, including allegations of torture.</p>&#13;\n<p>\"Documents indicate that in some instances UK intelligence officers were aware of inappropriate interrogation techniques,\"\u00a0the report said.</p>&#13;\n<p>\"(The) government or its agencies may have become inappropriately involved in some cases of rendition.\"</p>&#13;\n<p>In response the British government said on Thursday that a parliamentary committee would take over from Gibson's role and look at Gibson's outstanding concerns.</p>&#13;\n<p>Cabinet minister Ken Clarke said the inquiry's findings showed Britain's spy agencies had struggled to come to terms with the threat from armed groups after the 9/11 attacks.</p>&#13;\n<p><strong>Unprepared and inadequate</strong></p>&#13;\n<p>\"It is now clear that our agencies and their staff were in some respects not prepared for the extreme demands suddenly<br/>placed upon them,\" Clarke told parliament.</p>&#13;\n<p>\"Guidance regulating how intelligence officers should act was inadequate, the practices of some of our international partners should have been understood much sooner.
